AB  - This study examined the comparative efficacy of three interventions: a spouse-assisted coping skills training protocol for patients undergoing a multidisciplinary pain management programme (SA-MPMP), conventional patient-oriented multidisciplinary pain management programme (P-MPMP) and standard medical care (SMC). Thirty-six chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients and their spouses were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The SA-MPMP condition consisted of seven, weekly, 2-h, group sessions of training in dyadic pain coping and couple skills, delivered by a clinical psychologist with support of a multidisciplinary team of specialists, to patients together with their spouses. P-MPMP consisted of the SA-MPMP training delivered to the patient only (i.e., no spouse participation and assistance). The SMC condition entailed continuation of routine treatment, entailing medical care only. Data analysis revealed that, at the 12-month follow-up time point, patients receiving SA-MPMP had significant improvements in kinesiophobia and rumination about pain compared to those receiving P-MPMP and SMC. In patients suffering from CLBP, an intervention that combines spouse-assisted coping skills training with a multidisciplinary pain management programme can improve fear of movement and rumination about low back pain.

AB  - Background: Chronic pain is a common medical issue. Beside chronic devastating pain, patients also suffer dysfunction more generally, including in the physical, emotional, social, recreational, vocational, financial, and legal spheres. Integrated multidisciplinary and multimodal chronic pain management programmes offer clear evidence for relief of suffering and return to functional lifestyles. Materials and Methods: This retrospective review was performed in order to evaluate one-year outcomes among all newly referred patients of the multimodal chronic pain service at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM). All patients received multimodal pain therapy, including pharmacological, physical, and psychological therapy, exercise, and pain intervention. The variables evaluated were based on a patient's global pain assessments, which were made using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), modified by patient self-report, and were taken within days to months of commencing our multimodal pain regime. Results: A total of 169 patients were enrolled in this study. Out of this number, 102 (60.4%) were seen at the pain clinic, and 67 (39.6%) were referred while they were inpatients. About one-third of the patients had chronic pain due to cancer. Our data showed that 128 (75.7%) of our chronic pain patients were successfully managed when >=50% of pain relief (as measured by their VAS score) was achieved at any point during the course of the study period. In addition, 104 patients (61.5%) showed improvement in their modified ODI by 50% or more. Conclusion: A multimodal chronic pain service plays a significant role in managing chronic pain patients in a major hospital, as it is capable of delivering comprehensive and attainable care to manage refractory and intractable chronic pain.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 17(10) of The Journal of Pain (see record [rid]2016-46960-010[/rid]). In the original article, there were some errors in Table 2 and Table 3. The corrected tables are present in the erratum.] Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most frequently delivered psychological intervention for adults with chronic pain. The treatment yields modest effect sizes, and the mechanisms of action remain understudied and unclear. Efforts are needed to identify treatment mediators that could be used to refine CBT and improve outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether pain-related acceptance, from the psychological flexibility model, mediates changes in outcome over time in a CBT-based treatment program. This includes comparing how this variable relates to 3 other variables posited as potential mediators in standard CBT: life control, affective distress, and social support. Participants attended a 5-week outpatient multidisciplinary program with self-report data collected at assessment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up. Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to test for mediation in relation to 3 outcomes: pain interference, pain intensity, and depression. Results indicate that effect sizes for the treatment were within the ranges reported in the CBT for pain literature. Pain-related acceptance was not related to pain intensity, which is in line with past empirical evidence and the treatment objectives in acceptance and commitment therapy. Otherwise, pain-related acceptance was the strongest mediator across the different indices of outcome. Accumulated results like these suggest that acceptance of pain may be a general mechanism by which CBT-based treatments achieve improvements in functioning. More specific targeting of pain-related acceptance in treatment may lead to further improvements in outcome. Perspective: Potential mediators of outcome in a CBT-based treatment for adult chronic pain were investigated using multilevel structural equation modeling. The results highlight the role of pain-related acceptance as an important treatment process even when not explicitly targeted during treatment. These data may help clinicians and researchers better understand processes of change and improve the choice and development of treatment methods.

AB  - Background: The relevance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms to outcomes of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for chronic pain is unclear. This study examines whether (a) traumatic exposure or the severity of PTSD symptoms at pre-treatment predicts the outcomes (pain intensity/interference), (b) participation in this treatment is associated with reduced PTSD symptoms and (c) any observed changes in PTSD symptoms are mediated by changes in psychological mechanisms that have been shown to be of importance to PTSD and chronic pain. Method(s): Participants were 159 chronic pain patients who were consecutively admitted for a multidisciplinary, group-based CBT program at the Pain Rehabilitation Unit at Skane University Hospital. A self-report measure of traumatic exposure and PTSD symptoms was administered before and after treatment, and at a 12-month follow-up, along with measures of depression, anxiety, pain intensity, pain interference, psychological inflexibility, life control and kinesiophobia. Result(s): Traumatic exposure and PTSD symptom severity did not predict pain intensity or interference at 12-month follow-up. There were no overall significant changes in PTSD symptom severity at post-treatment or follow-up, but 24.6% of the participants showed potential clinically significant change at follow-up. Psychological inflexibility mediated the changes that occurred in PTSD symptoms during treatment. Conclusion(s): Neither traumatic exposure nor baseline symptoms of PTSD predicted the treatment outcomes examined here. Despite improvements in both comorbid depression and anxiety, participation in this pain-focused CBT program was not associated with improvements in comorbid PTSD. To the extent that changes in PTSD symptoms did occur, these were mediated by changes in psychological inflexibility during treatment. Significance: Pain-focused CBT programs yield clinically meaningful improvements in pain and comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety, but may have little effect on comorbid PTSD. This raises the issue of whether current pain-focused CBT programs can be modified to improve outcomes for comorbid conditions, perhaps by better targeting of psychological flexibility, and/or whether separate treatment of PTSD may be associated with improved pain outcomes.Copyright © 2020 European Pain Federation - EFIC

AB  - Objectives: To systematically assess the effectiveness of a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic long-term treatment interventions for the fibromyalgia syndrome [FMS]. Methods: Participants involved in an outpatient, one year, multidisciplinary treatment program within a health care setting were studied. After being screened for eligibility, participants in the treatment sample took part in combined standard pharmacologic treatment and non-pharmacologic treatment [including cognitive behavioral therapy/ psychoeducational classes, exercise, massage, auricular therapy, microcurrent therapy, and nutritional counseling] in a case controlled manner. A control sample received standard medical care in a rheumatologist's office. Pre- versus post-treatment outcome variables of psychological symptoms and personality features, as measured by the Multiaxial Diagnostic Inventory-Revised, overall impact of FMS as measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, overall health status as measured by the Short Form-36, pain and anxiety as measured by visual analog scales, and tender points were assessed for treatment study participants. Data were concurrently collected for the control sample on 26 of the 39 treatment variables, including the Multiaxial Diagnostic Inventory-Revised and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. Results: Seventy-eight participants took part in the combined pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment. The control sample consisted of 20 eligible participants. Using a quasi-experimental design, the results from a series of 2 [Group] X 2 [Test] one-way analysis of variance tests with repeated measures showed a significant decrease in pre- versus post-treatment measures of function, chronic depression, general anxiety, somatization, pain, anxiety, and tender points for the treatment group. A significant increase in Short Form-36 scores indicated a patient's perceived overall better health. No significant changes were revealed with the control group. Conclusions: These findings suggested the possible value of a long-term, multidisciplinary treatment program in alleviating FMS physical and psychological symptoms.

AB  - A treatment program for chronic pain is reported which focuses on modification of patient pain behavior. After an outpatient pain clinic screening by a multidisciplinary team, the patient with chronic pain (duration of 6 months or longer) is admitted for a 7--8 week inpatient program followed by a 4-week outpatient period. The first week of the inpatient program is used for evaluation of pain behaviors, recording use of pain medications, activity levels, and tolerance for special conditioning exercises. The program is aimed at extinguishing pain behaviors and use of pain medications, increasing activity level, reinforcing well behaviors, and returning patients to full active lives, normal for their sex and age. Of the 34 patients completing the program and returning to full active normal lives, 74% (25) have maintained this attained goal at the time of follow-up from 6 months to 7 years later.

AB  - Purpose: Which influence has an in-patient functional restoration program with the goal to improve work status on different pain and function parameters? What is the predictive validity of several clinical tests for the rehabilitation result? Method: Prospective cohort study with follow-up at 6 and 12 months. Pain intensity and pain localisation, lifting performance, maximum walking velocity, self-rating of the physical capacity and work status were assessed at admission and discharge. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to the patient (pain intensity and pain localisation) and family doctor (working activity). Results: 115 patients (92 male, 23 female). Age 42 +/- 8.5 years. There was no change in pain intensity and pain localisation from admission to discharge while there was a significant increase from discharge to 6 and 12 months. The work related capacity improved significantly from admission to discharge. The working status increased from 15 % at admission to 23 % after 6 months (P = 0.02) and to 28.5 % after 12 months (P= 0.004). 26 patients showed a positive result in the predictive tests while 89 didn't show any negative predictive factors. The group with positive predictive tests felt significantly more pain (P < 0.001), showed a worse work related capacity (P < 0.001) and did not significantly improve their working status after 6 and 12 months. The specifity of the predictive tests for the working status after 12 months is 0.86. Conclusions: Despite a primary function orientated treatment approach pain intensity and localisation remain unchanged while work related capacity and return to work after intervention shows significant improvements. Predictive tests help to identify patients who don't improve regarding work related capacity and working status. These predictive tests may indicate an unchanged working status after 12 months with a specificity of 0.86.

AB  - In view of a frequently poor success rate of rehabilitation programmes in patients with low back pain, a specific intervention programme was developed addressing the subgroup of patients with endurant pain coping behaviour and evaluated within a research project sponsored by the National federation of pension insurers, VDR. In terms of a control group design with 4 points of measurement (beginning and end of rehabilitation, 6- and 12-months follow-up), an intervention group (n = 163) was compared to a control group (standard programme of an orthopaedic rehabilitation clinic, n = 252). Data were collected using the KSL BDI, IRES, FFbH-R and a pain questionnaire. Subjects were blue-collar insurants, aged 46 on average with a pain history of 9.6 years. Findings show a stronger reduction of pain intensity and strain, significant enhancement of functional capacity as well as a greater decrease of sick leave days and pension requests. These results are presented over the course of the 4 points of measurement as well as in relation to the intervention programme, which focuses on the endurant pain coping behaviour. The consequences of implementing such therapy components into standard rehabilitation programmes are discussed. Â© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

AB  - Purpose: This study describes a subgroup of diagnostically heterogeneous chronic pain patients, with a lifetime history of physical and/or sexual abuse, who underwent a pain management programme. A battery of psychosocial and pain measures were assessed, as well as 1-year post-treatment socio economic outcomes. Method: The prevalence of a history of abuse was assessed via a semi-structured interview of 162 consecutive patients (112 females and 50 males) presenting for 4-8 weeks of treatment in an interdisciplinary, outpatient rehabilitation programme. Treatment outcome data were gathered immediately, 6 months and 1 year following discharge. The chronic pain patients with a history of abuse were compared to those without a history of abuse on several pre-treatment psychosocial variables - pain severity, psychological distress, DSM-IV Axis I comorbidity and health care utilization. Patient groups were matched on age, race, primary pain diagnosis, time in pain prior to treatment and gender. Results: Results indicated that 61% of patients had a history of lifetime physical and/or sexual abuse. Rates of sexual, and combined sexual and physical, abuse across the lifespan were higher for women than for men. Abused patients had a greater number of psychiatric diagnoses than nonabused patients. Abused patients also reported greater affective distress, less perceived life control, and a greater number of ER visits in the 6 months prior to treatment than their nonabused counterparts. A model consisting of gender (female), a higher number of psychiatric diagnoses, and higher affective distress was found to be a sensitive and relatively accurate predictor of abuse history. Finally, analyses indicated that, despite having greater psychosocial risk factors during the pre-treatment period, chronic pain patients with a history of abuse benefited from treatment and maintained treatment gains to a degree similar to nonabused chronic pain patients. Conclusions: Chronic patients with an abuse history can successfully complete a rehabilitation programme if the programme is designed to treat their psychosocial distress. Moreover, this also carries over to treatment outcome. A history of abuse does not have to negatively impact long-term treatment outcomes in this population of chronic pain patients.

AB  - Background: Within an intervention study in chronic low back pain patients treated in medical inpatient rehabilitation, a multimodal intervention program was implemented at a rehabilitation clinic (sponsored by VDR, 02508). The aim of the treatment was to reduce dysfunctional, particularly suppressive pain coping patterns. Methods: The study was aimed as a controlled study. Data were collected before and after rehabilitation as well as follow-up. 404 persons were included. Pain-related cognitions and coping behaviour were analysed by means of Kiel Pain Inventory. Results: The differences between groups were greater in the cognitive and emotional scales than in the behavior scales. Behavioral changes of the suppressive pain coping patterns in the intervention group appeared temporally delayed. Discussion: The effectivity of inpatient rehabilitation can be increased and stabilised up to 0,2 difference of effect size compared to control group by a more specific intensive and interdisciplinary therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a functional restoration program for patients with chronic low back pain, using overall disability and work ability as the primary evaluation criteria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied patients aged 18 years or older who had been on sick leave because of nonspecific low back pain for at least 3 months and whose job position was still open. The program was delivered on a day-hospital basis 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients were followed up for 1 year. RESULTS: We included 39 patients, 11 females and 28 males with a mean (+/- SD) age of 43 +/- 8 years and a mean sick-leave duration of 10 +/- 7 months. After 1 year, 26 (67%) patients reported improvements and 25 (64%) had returned to work. Compared to the year before the program, the number of sick leave days was decreased by 51% (120 +/- 140 vs. 244 +/- 114, P < 0.05). The work-and-leisure-activities subscore of the validated French version of the Dallas Pain Questionnaire (DRAD) was significantly improved (57 +/- 24 vs. 70 +/- 17 at baseline, P < 0.05). The patients still on sick leave after 1 year were older and had greater alterations in baseline DRAD subscores for anxiety/depression and daily activities, compared to the patients who had returned to work. CONCLUSIONS: Our functional restoration program was effective and allowed two-thirds of patients to resume work. Factors associated with failure to resume work were well-known correlates of chronicity. Our results support the use of functional restoration programs in patients with incapacitating low back pain. They suggest that functional restoration may deserve to be started earlier, after only 3 months with chronic pain, in patients who are unable to work.

AB  - Tested the effectiveness of 2 methods in the treatment of chronic low-back pain patients, namely specific physical exercises and selective attention in a group setting with ad hoc problem-solving discussions. Ss were 16 19–56 yr old male accident victims suffering from low back pain who had been unable to work for an average period of 6 yrs. They were given a battery of physical and psychological tests, including the MMPI. Ss were then divided into an experimental and a no-treatment control group. The treatment group met each week for 3 mo in a nonhospital setting. Results show some significant improvements for the treatment group as compared to the no-treatment group on both physical and psychological tests. 80% of the treatment group Ss had returned to work by a 3-yr follow-up compared to none of the controls.

AB  - Study Design. A prospective clinical trial was conducted that involved six groups of patients with chronic low back pain selected from a large cohort (N = 816). Objectives. To correlate pretreatment baseline variables with outcome parameters after treatment in a functional restoration program or in control programs, to identify possible factors predictive of the need for functional restoration. Summary of Background Data. Since the functional restoration program was first described, research has focused on identifying patients who will or will not benefit from such a program. The value of previous studies is limited, however, because predictive factors from a control group were not 'subtracted.' Methods. Eight hundred sixteen patients with chronic low back disability were included. All had a structured medical examination, including various physical tests before participation in either a functional restoration program (n = 621) or shorter 'control' outpatient programs (n = 144). A smaller group of the cohort (n = 51) had no treatment and served as a pure control group. Six groups were selected from the cohort: Three underwent an identical functional restoration program and three underwent different outpatient control programs. Several baseline demographic, physical, and so cioeconomic variables were correlated to 1- year outcome parameters. Results. Age, days of sick leave, connection to the work force, and back pain intensity, were significantly correlated to success 1 year after entry into the study in all groups, no matter what kind of treatment was administered. Back muscle endurance, sports activity, activity of daily living scores, and vibrations were of importance in some outcome parameters for success after functional restoration. Smoking was positively correlated to disability pension. Days of sick leave and, in functional restoration, ability to work were the only factors that were correlative with statistics for people who withdrew. Conclusions. Different factors can be identified as predictive of outcome in a functional restoration program, but most of these factors were also shown to predict success for shorter control outpatient programs or of no treatment.

AB  - Study Design. Two randomized, prospective clinical trials involving 238 chronic low back disability patients were carried out. Results at 2-year follow-up are presented. Objectives. To compare the clinical outcomes of a multidisciplinary functional restoration program with a nontreated control group (Project a) and with two less intensive but different training programs (Project B). Summary of Background Data. The effectiveness of functional restoration programs has not been firmly established. Results from trials carried out in the United States differ from those in trials conducted in other countries. Only a few of these studies have been carried out as prospective and randomized clinical studies. Methods. Two hundred thirty- eight patients with chronic low back disability of at least 6 months' duration were included. There were 106 patients in project A and 132 patients in project B. Two years after completion of treatment, patients were mailed a questionnaire that included questions regarding their work status, pain and disability levels, number of sick leave days, number of medical care contacts, medication use, physical activity levels, and subjective overall assessment of their 'back life situation.' Results. Patients in both studies were comparable at inclusion, except that patients in Project A were recruited from all of Denmark, whereas those in Project B were from the greater Copenhagen area. Thirteen patients did not report for treatment after randomization. Of the remaining 225 patients, 20 (9%) did not complete treatment. The questionnaire response rate was 94%. In Project A, those patients receiving treatment (functional restoration) reported significantly less contact with the health care system, fewer sick leave days, and a less disabled life style during the follow-up period, compared with reports of patients in the control group. Other effect parameters did not demonstrate a significant difference between the two groups. In Project B, all effect parameters reported, except leg pain and medication usage, were significantly in favor of functional restoration, compared with reports from the less intensively treated groups. Conclusions. The functional restoration program seems effective in various parameters compared with the less intensive programs, but the differences in outcome in the two parallel studies indicate the necessity of testing a treatment program in different settings, in that the statistical variation may be a major factor in results of different studies.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate an intensive, multidisciplinary functional restoration program for people with chronic low back pain. The program was compared to a non-treated control group in project A, and to less intensive treatment programs in project B. Both projects were randomized and observer blinded. Two hundred and thirty-eight patients were included, 106 entering project A and 132 project B. All had had chronic low back disability of at least six months duration, with an average of one year's sick leave due to low back pain over the last three years. Their average age was 41 years. The results at follow-up (conducted four months after treatment, follow-up rate 90% in project A and 86% in project B) showed that 67% of the treated patients in project A were able to work compared to 28% in the control group. In project B, 75% of the patients treated in the functional restoration program were able to work, the corresponding numbers from the less intensive programs being 48% and 40%. Numbers of days of sick leave, contacts to the health-care system and pain- and disability-scores were significantly lower for the patients treated in the functional restoration program compared to the other groups in both projects. Functional restoration is more expensive to carry out, but the long-term benefits in form of reductions in pensions, sick leave and contacts to the health-care system, not to mention reduced pain for the patients, seems to justify this expenditure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify and compare the course of health-related quality of life of immigrant native Italian-speaking and German-speaking patients before and after an interdisciplinary pain programme., DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with 1-12 month follow-up., SUBJECTS: Fibromyalgia, generalized widespread pain, and chronic non-specific back pain patients (Italian-speaking n = 96, German-speaking n = 199)., METHODS: Score changes measured with the Short Form 36 (SF-36) were compared with multivariate analysis using standardized mean differences (SMD), adjusted for sex, education and the baseline score., RESULTS: At baseline, health of the Italian-speaking patients was worse than for the German-speaking patients. Adjusted SMDs showed significantly better improvements in the German group compared with the Italian group: SF-36 Physical functioning SMD = 0.54 (at discharge) and 0.49 (at 12 months), General health SMD = 0.71 and 0.44, Vitality SMD = 0.43 and 0.48 in one sample. In the other sample, the corresponding SMDs were 0.06 (discharge), 0.50 (3 months) and 0.47 (6 months) for Bodily pain., CONCLUSION: State of health was better and health improvements were greater in German-speaking patients compared with Italian-speaking patients. Patients with a migration background may have special needs in therapeutic management, and addressing these might enhance the positive outcome in the short- and mid-term.

AB  - A better knowledge of differential treatment outcomes for subgroups of chronic spinal pain patients may, for instance, help clinicians in treatment planning or pain researchers in treatment outcome research. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the predictive validity of a subgroup classification based on the Swedish version of the (West Haven Yale) Multidimensional Pain Inventory, the MPI-S. Patients referred to a vocational rehabilitation program were classified into one of three groups, labeled 'adaptive copers', 'dysfunctional' patients, and 'interpersonally distressed' patients, and followed over an 18-month follow-up period. The outcome variables were absence from work (defined as sick listing plus early retirement), general health status, and utilization of health care resources. To our knowledge, the predictive validity of the MPI subgroups has not been evaluated regarding sick listing and early retirement after rehabilitation. As hypothesized, the results showed that the 'dysfunctional' patient group had significantly more registered absences from work and reported higher utilization of health care, over the follow-up period compared to the 'adaptive copers'. Furthermore, as hypothesized, the 'interpersonally distressed' and 'dysfunctional' patient groups report a poorer general health status than the 'adaptive copers' over the whole follow-up period. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the proportion of improved patients did not differ significantly between the subgroups. Altogether, the predictive validity of the MPI-S subgroup classification was mainly confirmed. The clinical implications of this study suggest that the matching of treatment to patient needs may enhance treatment outcome, reduce pain and suffering among chronic spinal pain patients and facilitate a better health economic allocation of treatment resources.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate body awareness and perceived health in patients with chronic pain after participation in a multimodal rehabilitation (MMR) programme and at 1-year follow-up. Method: Thirty-nine patients participated in a 5-week outpatient MMR programme. They were evaluated with the main outcome measures: the Body Awareness Scale (BAS) using an interview (BAS-I) and a movement test (BAS-Obs), the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) and the Sense of Coherence (SOC). A subgroup analysis was conducted based on the BAS-Obs scores at the start of the MMR programme with cut-off at the upper quartile > 26 point, classified as low body awareness; the three lower quartiles were classified as moderate/high body awareness. Results: All patients improved on the BAS-Obs and the BAS-I from the start to the end of the MMRP (p < 0.001) and at 1-year follow-up on four of the BAS-Obs subscales (p < 0.005). The moderate/high body awareness group improved on BAS-I, NHP and SOC (p < 0.01) and on two BAS-I subscales (p < 0.005), while the low body awareness group improved on one subscale (p = 0.003). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the use of the BAS-Obs assessment to identify patients with high or low levels of body awareness could play an important part in understanding the individual's clinical needs and be useful for developing an effective rehabilitation programme for patients with chronic pain., Copyright Â© 2014 Informa Healthcare.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential interaction between treatment content and subgroups according to the Swedish version of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI-S) on the effect on sickness absence during a 10-year follow-up in a population with chronic neck pain (NP) and/or low back pain (LBP). Methods: This study is based on a randomized controlled multicentre trial with a 10-year follow-up using the MPI-S and included 214 participants. The interventions consisted of Behavioural-oriented Physiotherapy (PT), Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Behavioural Medicine Rehabilitation (BM), and a 'treatment-as-usual' control group (CG). Results: There appears to be a difference in the development of sickness absence after rehabilitation for the adaptive coper (AC) group even though the result did not reach statistical significance. AC seems to respond most favourably to the multidisciplinary programme compared to the CG. The development of sickness absence after intervention among interpersonally distressed (ID) and dysfunctional (DYS) patients were similar across all three treatment alternatives as well as CG. Conclusion: In terms of long-term follow-up of sickness absence, the multidisciplinary programme appears to be most beneficial for DYS and AC patients. In contrast, the CBT and PT interventions failed to benefit any patient group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A valid method for classifying chronic pain patients into more homogenous groups could be useful for treatment planning, that is, which treatment is effective for which patient, and as a marker when evaluating treatment outcome. One instrument that has been used to derive subgroups of patients is the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI). The primary aim of this study was to evaluate a classification method based on the Swedish version of the MPI, the MPI-S, to predict sick leave among chronic neck and back pain patients for a period of 7 years after vocational rehabilitation. As hypothesized, dysfunctional patients (DYS), according to the MPI-S, showed a higher amount of sickness absence and disability pension expressed in days than adaptive copers (AC) during the 7-years follow-up period, even when adjusting for sickness absence prior to rehabilitation (355.8days, 95% confidence interval, 71.7; 639.9). Forty percent of DYS patients and 26.7% of AC patients received disability pension during the follow-up period. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Further analyses showed that the difference between patient groups was most pronounced among patients with more than 60days of sickness absence prior to rehabilitation. Cost-effectiveness calculations indicated that the DYS patients showed an increase in production loss compared to AC patients. The present study yields support for the prognostic value of this subgroup classification method concerning long-term outcome on sick leave following this type of vocational rehabilitation.

AB  - Background: Back pain is prevalent in the population, sometimes recurrent and may result in everyday and work disabilities. It is often a reason for seeking healthcare support. Analyzing the need of treatment and chronification-risk tailored intervention is a particular demand in healthcare delivery. Objective(s): Reducing downstream consequences of back pain (e.g. pain and disability) by using an interdisciplinary multimodal assessment followed by a risk-tailored intervention. Method(s): Patients with back pain (n= 1638) underwent assessments based on the German Pain Questionnaire (GPQ) and the diagnostic assessment each by a team comprising a physician, a psychologist and a physiotherapist. They were assessed answering a follow-up questionnaire after 6 and/or 12 months (n= 832) for success criteria sensitive to change as pain, everyday and work disability. Result(s): Patients had on average 62.5 days of work disability and 53.3% had pain up to one year. After assessment, 1447 patients (88.3%) were assigned to receive an intensive interdisciplinary multimodal back pain intervention. Intervention groups were: 120h of full-time treatment for 4 weeks (n= 1030) or 60h (n= 224), 48h part time treatment for 3 months (n= 87), and in-patient hospital treatment for about 17 days (n= 106). The effect sizes of success criteria were large to very large in all treatment groups. Conclusion(s): Tailored, interdisciplinary and intensive intervention is effective in reducing downstream consequences of back pain. The treatment assignment was based on patient reports (GPQ score) and multidisciplinary assessments (clinical evidence score). Tailored interventions should include sufficient intensity for highly disabled patients. Care integration such as timely communication between the health insurance system, back pain centers and usual healthcare services as well as patient- and process-related documentation are crucial for this intervention.

AB  - Objectives. - Evaluation of 1-year outcome after patients with chronic low back pain participated in an intensive functional restoration program associated with an ergonomic intervention on the workplace. Study of the factors predicts a return to work. Methods. - Prospective study of a cohort of 87 patients face major difficulties due to low back pain at work. Patients who visited a multidisciplinary clinic were included. Parameters, evaluating physical and psychological status, quality of life, presence at work, length of sick leaves, were determined before and after the program and at 6 and 12 months' followup. The correlation between these parameters and presence at work at 1 year was studied. Results. A total of 86 patients completed the program; three were lost to followup at 1 year. Ergonomic interventions were tried in 53 patients. All parameters were improved at the end of the program and remained significantly improved at 12 months. A total of 90% of the patients returned to work at the end of the program, whereas only 17% were at work before; 72% were at work in 1 year. The number of sick leave days decreased by 60%. The Dallas index at the beginning and the end of the program, the number of sick leave days before the program and score on the item feels able to work correlated with the presence at work in 1 year. There was no correlation between presence at work and physical parameters. Conclusion. This study shows the effect of the program and determines factors predictive of successful return to work for patients with chronic low back pain. Further data are necessary to discuss the specific effect of ergonomic interventions. © 2004 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits reserves.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the effectiveness of an intensive inpatient three-week multimodal therapy. We focused especially on the impact on the multimodal therapy outcome of the pre-admission number of treatment types patients had received and of medical specialist groups patients had consulted. METHODS: 155 patients with chronic low back pain and indication for multimodal therapy were evaluated with respect to pain intensity, depression, anxiety, well-being, and pre-admission health care utilization. In our controlled clinical trial we compared N = 66 patients on the waiting list with N = 89 patients who received immediate treatment. The waiting list patients likewise attended multimodal therapy after the waiting period. Longitudinal post-treatment data for both were collected at three- and twelve-month follow-ups. The impact of pre-admission health care utilization on multimodal therapy outcome (post) was analysed by structural equation model. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, multimodal therapy patients' pain intensity and psychological variables were significantly reduced. Longitudinal effects with respect to pre-measures were significant at three-month follow-up for pain intensity (ES = -0.48), well-being (ES = 0.78), anxiety (ES = -0.33), and depression (ES = -0.30). Effect sizes at twelve-month follow-up were small for anxiety (ES = -0.22), and moderate for general well-being (ES = 0.61). Structural equation model revealed that a higher number of pre-admission treatment types was associated with poorer post-treatment outcomes in pain intensity, well-being, and depression. CONCLUSION: Multimodal therapy proved to be effective with regard to improvements in pain intensity, depression, anxiety, and well-being. The association between treatment effect and number of pre-admission pain treatment types suggests that patients would benefit more from attending multimodal therapy in an earlier stage of health care.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain is prevalent, complex and most effectively treated by a multidisciplinary team, particularly if psychosocial issues are dominant. The limited access to and high costs of such services are often prohibitive for the rural patient. We describe the development and 18-month outcomes of a small multidisciplinary chronic pain management program run out of a physician's office in rural Alberta. METHODS: The multidisciplinary team consisted of a family physician, physiatrist, psychologist, physical therapist, kinesiologist, nurse and dietician. The allied health professionals were involved on a part-time basis. The team triaged referral information and patients underwent either a spine or medical care assessment. Based on the findings of the assessment, the team managed the care of patients using 1 of 4 methods: consultation only, interventional spine care, supervised medication management or full multidisciplinary management. We prospectively and serially recorded self-reported measures of pain and disability for the supervised medication management and full multidisciplinary components of the program. RESULTS: Patients achieved clinically and statistically significant improvements in pain and disability. CONCLUSION: Successful multidisciplinary chronic pain management services can be provided in a rural setting.

AB  - Investigated the psychosocial factors affecting the long-term employment outcome of 70 work-related upper extremity chronic pain disorder patients who had completed a multidisciplinary work rehabilitation program. Results from univariate analyses demonstrated that return-to-work status 1 yr after rehabilitation was predicted by number of Axis I disorders, a past diagnosis of substance abuse, a past and/or current diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, a history of childhood abuse, self-report of depressed mood, and a moderate to high level of perceived disability. Age, race, length of disability, and prior surgical treatment also predicted return-to-work rates. Multiple logistic regression further revealed that patients who were older, Caucasian, had an anxiety disorder, and whose perception of their disability deteriorated from pre- to post-program were significantly less likely to return to work. It is suggested that upper extremity patients be assessed and treated for psychosocial dysfunctions in conjunction with their rehabilitation so as to optimize favorable outcomes after treatment.

AB  - Multidisciplinary programmes using a vocational approach can enhance work return in chronic pain patients, but little is known about the long-term effects of rehabilitation. The current study examined the patterns of sickness absence 10 years after participation in 3 treatment groups (physiotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, and vocational multidisciplinary rehabilitation) in comparison to a control group receiving treatment-as-usual. Cost-effectiveness was also assessed. Two hundred fourteen patients participated in a randomized controlled trial and were followed-up via register data 10 years after the interventions. On average, persons in multidisciplinary rehabilitation had 42.98 fewer days on sickness absence per year compared to those treated-as-usual (95% confidence interval -82.45 to -3.52, P=0.03). The corresponding reduction of sickness absence after physiotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy was not significantly different from the control group. The effect of rehabilitation seems to be more pronounced for disability pension than for sick leave. The economic analyses showed substantial cost savings for individuals in the multidisciplinary group compared to the control group.

AB  - Self-management of chronic illnesses has been widely recognised as an important goal on quality of life, health service utilisation and cost grounds. This study describes the first published account on the application of this approach to people suffering from chronic pain conditions in a Southeast Asian country, Malaysia. A heterogeneous sample of chronic pain patients in Malaysia attended a 2-week cognitive-behavioural pain management programme (PMP) aimed at improving daily functional activities and general psychological well-being. Complete datasets from 70 patients out of 102 patients who attended 11 programmes conducted from 2002 to 2007, as well as the 1-month and 1-year follow-up sessions at the hospital clinic, are reported. The pre- to post-treatment results on self-report measures indicate that significant gains were achieved on the dimensions of pain, disability and psychological well-being. These gains were maintained at both 1-month and 1-year follow-ups. The results mirror those reported from similar interventions in Europe and North America and indicate the concept of self-management of a chronic illness is acceptable and meaningful to Asian patients. Importantly, the achieved outcomes were independent of gender and ethnic group status. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is growing evidence to support Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in the management of chronic pain. However, there is a need for further research evaluating ACT combined with physical exercise, and few studies have assessed the long-term impact of this type of intervention. This case series reports on the acceptability and impact of an ACT-based multidisciplinary pain management programme on a range of health outcomes in both the short and long-term. METHOD(S): Seventy-three participants completed an 8-week group-based, pain management programme. The programme combined weekly sessions of ACT with education and exercise classes. Self-report outcome measures were completed at baseline, post-intervention and at one-year follow-up. The measures assessed pain intensity and interference, psychological distress, self-efficacy, pain acceptance, values-based action, pain catastrophizing, fear avoidance and healthcare utilization. Pedometers were worn to objectively measure physical activity. Data were analyzed using linear mixed modelling. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH) Institutional Review Board (Reference 1/378/1541). RESULT(S): Eighty-six percent of respondents reported being satisfied with the intervention. Improvements were observed in most of the self-report outcomes post-intervention and many changes were maintained at one-year. There was also a significant increase in average daily step-count. CONCLUSION(S): A pain management programme combining ACT with exercise appears to be an acceptable treatment option for people with chronic pain. While improvements were observed in both the short and long-term, further fully powered RCTs with long-term follow-up are required to test the effectiveness of this type of intervention.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN. Population-based, incidence cohort. OBJECTIVES. To evaluate a government policy of funding community and hospital-based fitness training and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for whiplash. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Although insurance benefits commonly include rehabilitation for whiplash, its effectiveness is unknown. METHODS. All Saskatchewan adults treated for whiplash (n = 6,021) over a 2-year period were followed up at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Recovery was defined by self-report of improvement. Recovery times were compared between those attending fitness training at health clubs (n = 833), multidisciplinary outpatient rehabilitation (n = 468), and multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation (n = 135) to those receiving usual insured individual care. RESULTS. Recovery was 32% slower in those receiving fitness training within 69 days of injury (P = 0.001) and 19% slower when received within 119 days of injury (P = 0.041). Recovery was 50% slower in those receiving outpatient rehabilitation within 119 days of injury (P = 0.001). Attending inpatient rehabilitation did not influence recovery rates during the follow up (P = 0.131). Multivariable adjustment for important prognostic factors did not change these results. CONCLUSIONS. We found no evidence to support the effectiveness of a population-based program of fitness training and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for whiplash. Rehabilitation programs should be tested in randomized trials before being recommended to injured populations. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Severe chronic low back pain was diagnosed in 236 patients by one physician and they were referred to the University of Miami Comprehensive Pain and Rehabilitation Center (UMCPRC) over a 5-year period for an intensive 4-week inpatient treatment program. Of these 143 (61%) were able to be contacted by telephone and given a structured interview designed for the study. The average time elapsed at follow-up from referral for all patients was 22.5 months. Outcome was measured in the following terms: current levels of pain, percent decrease in pain, subsequent health care utilization, activities of daily living, and attitudes toward treatment. After completion of the interview, the McGill Pain Questionnaire and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire were sent to the patients. The patients fell into five groupings: Group 1 - participants in the UMCPRC program (n = 39); Group 2 - those whose participation was not approved by insurance (n = 30); Group 3 - those who declined participation (n = 46); Group 4 - participants in other programs (n = 14) ; Group 5 - dropouts (n = 14). The five groups were not meaningfully different with regard to prereferral demographics. Interestingly, Group 1 patients exhibited significantly greater prereferral pain and unemployment levels. Despite this, at follow-up significantly more Group 1 members were employed and they exhibited a greater percent decrease in pain as compared to the nonparticipant groups. Returned McGill and Oswestry Questionnaires mirrored these findings. Group 1 members also demonstrated significantly lower rates of subsequent health care utilization, i.e., physician visits, hospitalizations, and surgery than the nonparticipant groups. In conclusion, independent evaluation suggests that the type of program given at UMCPRC is effective for the treatment of chronic intractable low back pain. Future directions are briefly discussed.

AB  - Objective: To compare the effectiveness of three treatment strategies for chronic low back pain with varying biomechanical intensity and multidisciplinary approach. Methods: A monocentric controlled trial with a 12-months follow-up, conducted in the French Valley Loire region from May 2009 to April 2013. Participants were working-aged patients with chronic low back pain referred to a French chronic low back pain care-network to support medical and occupational issues. Three treatment strategies, each for five weeks were compared: (i) intensive and multidisciplinary program conducted in a rehabilitation center; (ii) less intensive outpatient program conducted by a trained private physiotherapist; (iii) mixed strategy combining the same outpatient program associated with a weekly multidisciplinary intervention. The effects of treatment conditions were compared using an "intention to treat" approach: number of days' sick leave during the 12-months following treatment, and quality of life and social ability assessed by auto-questionnaires. Results: A total of 349 patients (52.2% men, 42.5 +/- 8.7 years old, median duration of sick leave = 206.0 days [92.0-301.0]) were included. Sick leave duration significantly decreased during the 12 months following treatment in the three groups. Physical capacity improved in intensive program and mixed strategy groups. There was no significant difference for the evolution of participants' quality of life, social ability, and personal beliefs between the three groups. Conclusion: This study confirms that disparate treatments might show similar effectiveness because they could all work through concomitant changes in beliefs, attitudes, and coping mechanisms. The original mixed strategy can treat a larger number of chronic low back pain patients, at a lower cost and provide local community-based care. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - One hundred patients were selected who had completed an outpatient rehabilitation program designed to teach competent coping with chronic pain. Data at follow-up periods averaging 21 months posttreatment indicated statistically significant decreases in subjective pain intensity and increases in activities of daily living with substantial reductions in use of medications for pain. Changes from pretreatment to follow-up were not significantly different among groups of patients with pending, current, or no disability. Eight of 19 unemployed persons who had pending disability claims had returned to work at follow-up. It was concluded that considerable changes in function can occur with relatively brief outpatient pain rehabilitation and that pending or current disability is not necessarily an indication of likely treatment failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of specific and clinically relevant Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profile types to predict outcomes in a structured interdisciplinary pain-management program for patients with low back pain. DESIGN: Subjects were divided into clusters representing MMPI profiles yielding similar clinical interpretation. Analyses of variance and chi-square testing assessed the effect of cluster group on a variety of outcome measures at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6- to 66-month follow-up. Fisher's Least Significant Difference Test assessed the significance of differences between pairs of cluster groups. SETTING: A university-based comprehensive interdisciplinary pain-management program serving both inpatients and outpatients. PATIENTS: 122 subjects with chronic low back pain who completed the program, provided follow-up data, and fit into the definition of one of seven clusters. MAJOR OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reports of subjective pain intensity, pain-related medication intake, and activity level at pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up; employment status at pretreatment and follow-up. RESULTS: Cluster groups did not differ significantly at any time on activity level and medication intake and differed on employment status only at pretreatment. There was a significant (p 80) on both Hypochondriasis and Hysteria. CONCLUSION: Even when subjects with chronic pain are divided into cluster groups associated with highly similar clinical interpretations, the MMPI for the most part fails to predict self-reported outcomes in an interdisciplinary pain-management program.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical and social benefits of a pain management programme in Hong Kong. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary out-patient clinic, Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic non-cancer pain and prolonged (mean, 46 months) psychosocial disability who joined the Comprehensive Outpatient Pain Engagement programme between 2002 and 2012. INTERVENTION: A structured 6-week out-patient pain rehabilitation course designed to improve function and reduce disability, regardless of the cause or severity of pain. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Social outcomes included return-to-work rate, hospital admissions, and out-patient visits. Physical outcomes included tolerance to sitting and standing. Psychological constructs such as mood, catastrophisation, self-efficacy, quality of life, and perceived performances were used. Each measure was taken before and 1 year after the programme. RESULTS: There was significant increase in return-to-work rate 1 year after commencement of the programme (35% after vs 17% before the programme; odds ratio=3.01), reduction in medical utilisation, and improvement in all physical and psychological measures. Pain intensity, psychological distress, and history of work-related injuries were not related to the likelihood of return to work. Shorter duration of pain and higher physical functioning score in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey were prognostic indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic pain who joined the Comprehensive Outpatient Pain Engagement programme showed significant functional improvement despite the long history of pain.

AB  - Attachment theory and research suggest that patterns of interpersonal relationships may be important determinants of illness behavior, care seeking, and treatment response in individuals with chronic health problems, including chronic pain. Attachment styles have been shown to be associated with psychological adjustment in the context of chronic illness, but little research has been conducted so far examining these relationships in patients with chronic pain. We assessed 111 patients with chronic pain participating in a multidisciplinary pain treatment program to determine if attachment style is associated with pain, depression, catastrophizing and physical disability at pre-treatment and 12-month follow-up, and with change in health care utilization pre-treatment to follow-up. At both pre-treatment and follow-up, fearful attachment style was associated with significantly greater depression and catastrophizing, and secure attachment was associated with significantly lower levels of depression. Preoccupied attachment style was associated with greater than weekly pain-related visits at 12 months follow-up, even after controlling for depression, catastrophizing and pre-treatment pain-related health care utilization. The findings suggest that attachment style may be a useful construct for examining factors affecting adjustment and treatment response of patients with chronic pain.

AB  - 121 patients (mean age 43.8 yrs) with primary pain complaints, predominantly in the low back or head/neck/face regions, participated in a 4-wk inpatient treatment package consisting of controlled medication reduction, physical therapy, behavioral group therapy, self-monitoring, contracting, and biofeedback/relaxation training. Several measures of verbal/nonverbal pain behavior and physical functioning were obtained over the baseline, treatment, and follow-up periods. Results show significant reductions in analgesic medication use and verbal/nonverbal pain behavior and improvements in physical functioning, employment status, and pro-health behaviors that were maintained at 12-mo follow-up.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary therapeutic regime in selected patients with disabling chronic pain requiring sick leave and refractory to standard therapies. Materials and methods: One hundred and four patients with disabling chronic pain received multidisciplinary intensive treatment (medical, psychological, physical and occupational therapies) five hours a day, four days a week, over 4 weeks. Revisions were scheduled at discharge and at 6 and 12 months after the end of the treatment. Results: At discharge after the treatment, significant reductions of painful, depressive and anxious symptoms were observed, as well as a significant increase of the functional capacity (Pain (VAS): 7.4+/-1.6 vs 3.4+/-2) cm (p<0.0001); Depression (BDI): 17+/-9 vs 10+/-8) points (p<0.0001); Anxiety (HARS): 19+/-8 vs 14+/-7) points (p<0.0001); Disability (HAQ): 1.7+/-0.4 vs 0.6+/-0.5 points) (p<0.0001). The sizes of the effect ranged between a maximum value of 2.5 (VAS pain) and a minimum value of 0.6 (HARS), suggesting in all the cases a wide to moderate clinical change. At that time, 75 (78%) patients have returned to their work activity. During the follow-up, the significant improvements in the output variables were maintained. Of the 62 patients that completed the one-year follow-up, 47 (63%) maintained their active work life. Conclusions: Multidisciplinary therapeutic regimes for disabling noncancer chronic pain are effective for the relief of pain and suffering in selected patients from our setting, and reverse a high percentage of job disability. © 2004 Sociedad Espanola del Dolor.

AB  - Background and Objective: Disabling chronic pain is especially devastating among working population and, in many cases, it does not respond to conventional therapies. In chronic pain, the importance of psychosocial and occupational factors, in addition to biological ones, has prompted the development of successful multidisciplinary treatment programmes in various countries. We assessed the outcome of a multidisciplinary therapeutic program for work-disabled selected patients with chronic pain refractory to conventional treatment. Patients and Method: The study included 70 patients (58 women, mean age [SD]: 42 [9] years) with chronic pain and sick leave (mean [SD]: 7 [4] months of work disability) diagnosed with fibromyalgia (51%), chronic low back pain (16%), regional myofascial pain (15%), cervicocraneal syndrome (3%), anquilosing spondylitis (3%), and other conditions (12%). All patients had received previous pharmacological treatment, physical therapy and/or other measures (surgery in 12% cases) without improvement. All patients underwent an intensive multidisciplinary treatment of 4 weeks' duration including medical techniques for pain control, cognitive-behavioural therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. Average follow-up was 10 (4) months (1-24 months) post-discharge. Results: Significant improvements were observed with regard to all relevant variables, as reflected in pre and post-discharge measures: pain (Visual-Analogue Scale 1-10 cm): 7.4 (1.5) versus 3.2 (2) (p < 0.01); anxiety (HARS), 19 (7) versus 14 (8) (p < 0.01); depression (BDI), 16 (8) versus 10 (8) (p < 0.01); functional ability (HAQ), 1.6 (0.4) versus 0.6 (0.5) (p < 0.001). At discharge, 73% of patients returned to work. In addition, 69% of treated patients maintained the acquired improvement and their employment status at the end of follow-up. Conclusion: Multidisciplinary treatment of chronic pain with special attention to work return is useful for selected patients with a disabling chronic pain syndrome refractory to conventional treatment.

AB  - We report on a comprehensive and intensive cognitive-behavioural treatment programme which is conducted by behavioural therapists working primarily in patients' homes. All 72 patients reported chronic pain, several previous attempts at traditional treatment and all patients had been vocationally disabled for over 2 years because of pain at the time of assessment. After an average of 5.2 months in treatment, 70.9% were able to make a significant lifestyle change (e.g., return to full or part-time work, etc.) and reported significant reductions in pain levels and increased coping abilities. These results were maintained at follow-up, which was carried out an average of 18.6 months after treatment, with 69.4% of the patients remaining in the successful categories. Results are promising and suggest the need for controlled studies.

AB  - Introduction: Multidisciplinary rehabilitation has beneficial effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases. However, whether this intervention benefits different age groups in women or men is largely unknown. Purpose: To investigate HRQoL in patients with chronic rheumatic disease after completion of a 3-week multidisciplinary treatment, with special focus on differences in effect between age and gender groups. Method: HRQoL was measured with SF-36. Mean scores for all SF-36 domains were compared before and after the 3-week regimen and again at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Multivariable linear regression models using generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measurement were employed. A weighting procedure to account for differential dropouts was applied. Results: Three hundred fifty-six women and 74 men with chronic rheumatic disease were included. There were short-term improvements in all SF-36 domains irrespective of age or gender. These effects persisted for up to 1 year in the psychological, social, and energy domains for women under 50. We found no lasting effects for men; however, young men showed similar trends. Conclusion: Inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation improves short-term HRQoL in all patients. Younger women maintain these beneficial effects for up to 1 year. Additional intervention should be considered for elderly women and for men in order to sustain rehabilitation effects.

AB  - Chronic low back pain is a common reason for medical consultation, with significant impact on functional and professional status of affected patients. Many treatments are available. One of these, a back school program, is a multidisciplinary approach involving therapeutic education and physical exercise. The variety of potential options to treat chronic low back pain and the difficulty of long-term follow-up were the main reasons leading us to carry out this study. Our back school protocol consists of therapeutic education, along with cognitive-behavioral approach and gradual musclestrengthening exercises. In this article, we have presented our experience with back school and our study results regarding 394 chronic low back pain patients assessed on the short-(end-ofprogram evaluation), medium-(6-month evaluation), and longterm (12-month evaluation). The study's main outcome parameters included the benefits of back school on pain, as well as its impact on quality of life, functional status, and professional status. Our back school protocol yielded significant benefits that were maintained over the mediumand long-term. Furthermore, we observed a high rate of patients returning to work.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of improvement in negative emotional cognitions, active cognitive coping, and control and chronicity beliefs to the outcome of multidisciplinary treatment in patients with chronic widespread pain. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PATIENTS: A total of 120 subjects diagnosed with chronic widespread pain, who completed a multidisciplinary pain programme. METHODS: Data from baseline, 6 months and 18 months follow-up measurements were analysed. Longitudinal relationships were analysed between changes in cognitions and outcome, using generalized estimated equations. Outcome domains included: pain, interference of pain in daily life, depression, and global perceived effect. Cognitive domains included: negative emotional cognitions, active cognitive coping and control and chronicity beliefs. RESULTS: Improvements in negative emotional cognitions were associated with improvements in all outcome domains, in particular with improvement in interference of pain with daily life and depression (between baseline and 6 months, and 6 and 18 months). Improvements in active cognitive coping were associated with improvements in interference of pain in daily life (between baseline and 6 months). Improvements in control and chronicity beliefs were associated with improvements in pain and depression (between 6 and 18 months). CONCLUSION: Improvement in negative emotional cognitions seems to be a key mechanism of change in multidisciplinary treatment of chronic widespread pain. Improvement in active cognitive coping and improvement in control and chronic timeline beliefs may also constitute mechanisms of change, although the evidence is less strong.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the associations between (improvement in) fatigue and (improvement in) clinical and cognitive factors in patients with chronic widespread pain (CWP), participating in multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment. METHODS: Data were used from baseline, 6 and 18 months of follow-up during a prospective cohort study of 120 CWP patients who completed multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment. Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships were analyzed between fatigue, clinical (i.e. pain, interference of pain and depression) and pain related cognitive factors (i.e. negative emotional cognitions, active cognitive coping, and control and chronicity beliefs). RESULTS: Higher levels of pain, interference of pain, depression, negative emotional cognitions, and negative control and chronicity beliefs were associated with a higher level of fatigue. Improvement in depression was related to improvement in fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: In CWP patients, worse clinical status, and dysfunctional pain-related cognitions are associated with a higher level of fatigue. Our results suggest that improvement in depression might be a mechanism of improvement in fatigue. Furthermore, improvement in fatigue seems to be independent of improvement in pain related cognitions. Targeting fatigue in multidisciplinary pain treatment may need specific strategies. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Improvement in depression may be a mechanism of change to improve the level of fatigue in CWP. Improvement in dysfunctional (pain related) cognitions seems to be independent of improvement in fatigue. Targeting fatigue in multidisciplinary treatment may need specific strategies (e.g. additional interventions focusing on reducing fatigue and specific attention to improvement of sleep).

AB  - Background: In recent years, rehabilitation aftercare has become an important topic in rehabilitation research and practice. This development was initiated by the lack of long-term effects after rehabilitation treatment and by the deficits identified in several reviews of aftercare recommendations and of actual practice of aftercare. Against this background, a new aftercare strategy was developed, the "New Credoo", which focused aftercare from the beginning of rehabilitation treatment. A substantial element of the concept is the resumption and maintenance of physical activity in everyday life of the rehabilitation patient. The goal of the present study was the evaluation of this concept in a sample of patients with chronic back pain. Method: The "New Credoo" was evaluated in a multi-centre, prospective controlled longitudinal study with 3 points of measurement (before and after rehab as well as after 12 months). 6 rehabilitation clinics in Schleswig-Holstein were included in the intervention arm (IG, 3 clinics) and in the control arm (CG, 3 clinics), participants were rehabilitants with chronic back pain. The clinics in the intervention arm implemented the New Credo" in accordance with their local conditions. During the study period they were provided with a person who was responsible for managing aftercare activities for patients. Participants in the CG received standard rehabilitation treatment according to general guidelines. Restriction of social participation, disability days and restriction in functional capacity in everyday life were defined as primary outcomes. Complete data were available for 166 rehabilitants in the IG and 368 in the CG. Results: At the end of rehabilitation rehabilitants in the IG reported significantly higher use of treatment offerings and more intensive preparation for the time after rehabilitation treatment than rehabilitants in the CG. Rehabilitants in the IG found recommendations for the time after treatment significantly better than those in the CG. As expected, both rehabilitants in the IG and in the CG showed similar outcomes directly after inpatient treatment. With respect to long-term effects 12 months later, significant differences with moderate effect sizes were observed in 2 of the 3 primary outcomes (function capacity and social participation) in favour of the IG. With respect to secondary outcomes, rehabilitants in the IG showed significantly better long-term results than those in the CG. Discussion and conclusion: Our results show that the "New Credoo" can successfully be implemented into rehabilitation practice. The "New Credoo" was positively rated by clinicians and rehabilitants. Rehabilitants in the IG found offerings of supported aftercare very helpful. The intensity of actual use of aftercare by rehabilitants as well as the emphasis laid on aftercare by clinicians indicate that treatment was focused on aftercare over the whole time of rehabilitation and that the rehabilitants transferred these aspects into everyday life. For the rehabilitants in the IG higher long-term effects could be observed compared to those in the CG. This suggests an improved sustainability of rehabilitation effects and a successful transfer of acquired knowledge and self-efficacy in everyday life. Â© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.

AB  - In-patient pain programs try to help the thousands of people that suffer from chronic pain cope with their pain. This study examines Medicare patients who have participated in an abbreviated version (1 to 2 weeks) of the Multidisciplinary Pain and Stress Rehabilitation Program, at the Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, to those who participated in the full version (3 to 4 weeks). Success in the program will be measured by patients' functional capacity at home, reduced pain perceived, reduced medication usage and improvement of psychological status immediately after completing the program and one to three years later (Study One) and then again five to nine years later (Study Two). The participants in the follow-up one study are twenty-three Medicare patients who have completed the Pain and Stress Rehabilitation Program at the Miami Valley Hospital and seventeen private insurance patients who completed the longer, four week program. A control group of ten participants who were accepted into the program but chose not to participate were also used in the follow-up one study. The participants in the follow-up two study are twelve Medicare patients who where involved in the original follow-up one study and twelve private insurance patients who were involved in the original follow-up one study. The follow-up two study was performed five years after the follow-up two study, which would be five to nine years after the original participants completed the pain program. The purpose of this study is to compare patients who have participated in a short version of the program consisting of one to two weeks of therapy to patients who have completed the full four-week program as well as to determine the long-term success of the program.

AB  - Study Design: A stratified randomized single-blinded clinical trial. Objective: To compare the efficacies of 2 active therapies for chronic low back pain (CLBP). Summary of Background Data: Both a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation program and an intensive individual therapist-assisted back muscle strengthening exercise program used in Denmark have been reported to be effective for the treatment of CLBP. Methods: A total of 286 patients with CLBP were randomized to either a group-based 12-week program comprising 73 hours of therapist exposure (approximately 12 h/patient): 35 hours of hard physical exercise, 22 hours of light exercise/occupational therapy, and 16 hours of education (group A) or a 12-week program comprising 1 hour of personal training twice a week, i.e., therapist exposure 24 h/patient (group B). At baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, patients filled out questionnaires on pain (visual analogue scale [VAS]-pain average, which was the primary outcome measure), Roland-Morris disability questionnaire, global perceived outcome, and 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey. Data were analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle. Results: of the 286 patients, 14 patients did not start treatment. of the remaining patients, 25 (9%) dropped out of therapy. The 2 groups were comparable regarding baseline characteristic. After treatment, significant improvements were observed with regard to pain, disability, and most of the quality of life dimensions. These effects were sustained over the 24-month follow-up period. There were some statistically significant differences between the 2 groups relating to secondary end points, Roland-Morris disability questionnaire, and in the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey the "physical functioning" dimension and the "physical component Summary." Conclusion: Both groups showed long-term improvements in pain and disability scores, with only minor statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. The minor outcome difference in favor of the group-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation program is hardly of clinical interest for individual patients. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Study Design: A stratified randomized single-blinded clinical trial. Objective: To compare the efficacies of 2 active therapies for chronic low back pain (CLBP). Summary of Background Data: Both a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation program and an intensive individual therapist-assisted back muscle strengthening exercise program used in Denmark have been reported to be effective for the treatment of CLBP. Methods: A total of 286 patients with CLBP were randomized to either a group-based 12-week program comprising 73 hours of therapist exposure (approximately 12 h/patient): 35 hours of hard physical exercise, 22 hours of light exercise/occupational therapy, and 16 hours of education (group A) or a 12-week program comprising 1 hour of personal training twice a week, i.e., therapist exposure 24 h/patient (group B). At baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, patients filled out questionnaires on pain (visual analogue scale [VAS]-pain average, which was the primary outcome measure), Roland-Morris disability questionnaire, global perceived outcome, and 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey. Data were analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle. Results: of the 286 patients, 14 patients did not start treatment. of the remaining patients, 25 (9%) dropped out of therapy. The 2 groups were comparable regarding baseline characteristic. After treatment, significant improvements were observed with regard to pain, disability, and most of the quality of life dimensions. These effects were sustained over the 24-month follow-up period. There were some statistically significant differences between the 2 groups relating to secondary end points, Roland-Morris disability questionnaire, and in the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey the "physical functioning" dimension and the "physical component Summary." Conclusion: Both groups showed long-term improvements in pain and disability scores, with only minor statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. The minor outcome difference in favor of the group-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation program is hardly of clinical interest for individual patients. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate physical functioning in a nurse-led integrated physiotherapy and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) approach in treatment of people suffering from chronic pain. BACKGROUND: Inter-professional working and physical activity supervision is described as important components of successful rehabilitation and is often included in approaches to chronic pain. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental nonrandomised controlled design was used. METHOD: A consecutive sample of 117 outpatients from a rehabilitation unit at a university hospital was included in this intervention study. The effects of an 8-week multidisciplinary programme, including 6 and 12 month follow-up, was examined with measures including health-related quality of life (HRQL), pain perception, pain stages of change and physical functioning. To broaden our understanding qualitative data from three physiotherapists involved were collected. RESULTS: Improvements in physical functioning status during the programme were positively related to improvements in stages of change, pain interference (PI) and severity (PS) and HRQL. Qualitative data support these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that our pain management intervention, that includes physical activity designed to help patients to live a healthier life, can have a clinically assessable impact on reducing PI and PS, improving physical functioning and HRQL. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Training in CBT approaches and inter-professional working in chronic pain may extend the skills of nurses and physiotherapists to improve physical functioning among a group of patients for whom traditional medicine has little to offer.

AB  - AIM: This article is a report of a Norwegian-revised study on the effectiveness of a follow-up multidisciplinary management programme for chronic pain to investigate the change processes associated with treatment. BACKGROUND: Substantial evidence supports the use of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approaches to chronic pain. As relapse is often reported, follow-up sessions should be included. METHODS: A follow-up quasi-experimental design was performed, and a previous control group was used. The study initially included 117 participants, and 104 of the sample completed the 6- and 12-month follow-up programme. The 6-month follow-up consisted of therapeutic dialogue and education combined with physical activity. At the 12-month follow-up, a telephonic consultation was conducted. The data collection period was between September 2006 and January 2008. The statistical and clinical significance were considered. RESULTS: Findings suggest that this follow-up programme can potentially maintain the positive results of the basic programme in terms of reduced pain perception, improved health-related quality of life, and movement towards self-management. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with the ultimate goal of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approaches, which is to help patients with chronic pain to cope more effectively and to improve their health-related quality of life and functioning. To maintain treatment improvements and advance nursing, there is a clear need for research that tests the efficacy of follow-up interventions that are designed to prevent drop out and relapse.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate an 8-week multidisciplinary pain management program offered to patients suffering from chronic pain. The study initially included 88 participants, and 61 of the sample completed a follow-up program conducted at 6 and 12 months after the initial programs. The pain management program was based on a cognitive behavioral approach with active patient participation in learning new coping skills. The intervention consisted of supervised dialog, physical activity, and education. The main goals were change of focus from pain and disability to resources and functional coping strategies. It was hypothesized that the positive changes gained at posttest registration after an 8-week program on coping, health-related quality of life, and pain intensity would be maintained during follow-up sessions. The results indicated that these hypotheses were mainly supported and further pain reduction, decreased emotion-focused coping, better social functioning, and overall physical and mental health gains were observed. The participants who did not complete the follow-up program did not differ from the patients who completed the program on background variables investigated. The study also supported the claim that professional nurses are competent to lead such programs and to evaluate treatment results. Clinical and research implications are discussed.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term effects in self-perceived occupational performance and satisfaction in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) for patients with Whiplash Associated Disorders (WAD) with chronic pain in an interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme, and investigate patients' opinions of programme effects. METHOD: A mixed-method with sequential explanatory design was used. Fifty-three patients with WAD were followed-up 12 months after discharge. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure was used to evaluate the change in ADL and the Multidimensional Pain Inventory for psychosocial functioning. Telephone interviews, based on five structured questions about the perceived impact of the rehabilitation programme, were made. RESULTS: The 12-month follow-up showed significant ADL improvement (p < 0.001). There was less interference in daily activities due to pain (p < 0.01), and life control increased. More people were back to work. Interviews revealed the programme's environment as strengthening and safe, and participants felt they were met with respect. Key success factors were to be treated with respect to being part of the social context and to obtain new knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme had initiated a process of change towards a more active life for the participants. They had found a new way of managing their lives. Despite the absence of pain reduction, they managed ADL in a better way, had more life control and returned to work to a higher degree. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Chronic pain after WAD effects the entire life for many people. Long-term effects on activities of daily living, life control and work ability have shown positive results after an interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme based on behavioural and cognitive principles. The key success factors were to be treated with respect to being a part of a social context and to obtain new knowledge.

AB  - In this prospective investigation, 80 vocational rehabilitation clients with locomotor pain ("algias") were investigated. Symptoms (23 items; yes/no alternatives), signs (24 items; sign present/not present), and a series of demographic and psycho-social variables (11 items) were recorded. Symptoms and signs generally characterized the clients as "dorsalgic" rather than suffering from low back or neck pain. In spite of this fact, factor analyses formed seven symptom and eight sign factors, which in a subsequent factor analysis pairwise formed statistical, yet meaningful, entities (meta-factors) suggesting five regional, two postural, and one relational "syndrome." These syndromes may not necessarily be generalizable but they may be of clinical descriptory value. At the 2-year follow-up, the vocational outcome (success/failure) for 73% of the subjects could be correctly classified. The most powerful overall predictors, particularly for the failures, were sex and belief in vocational return, whereas only one of the syndromes had predictive impact. Hence, psycho-socio-demographic variables appear to be of greater importance in predicting the outcome of vocational rehabilitation for chronic pain patients than the symptoms and signs recorded by the physician.

AB  - Background context: Multiple compensation injury claims are an understudied phenomenon in the chronic back pain and occupational injury literature. Assumptions about poor treatment outcomes for patients presenting with prior injury can lead to denial of treatment, even though these assumptions have not been empirically addressed. Functional restoration has been demonstrated to be an effective rehabilitation treatment for disabling, work-related chronic back pain, although its' relative utility with recurrent injury (RI) patients has not been previously evaluated. Purpose: To assess demographic, psychosocial and work history/adjustment differences between the two groups, and to investigate whether patients with recurrent work-related spinal injury claims benefit from functional restoration treatment at a level equivalent to patients with nonrecurrent injuries. Study design/setting: A prospective cohort design assessing characteristics and outcomes of patients with recurrent work-related spinal disorders, compared with a group of patients without prior work-related spine injury claims, all treated with the same interdisciplinary rehabilitation protocol. Patient sample: A cohort of consecutively treated functional restoration rehabilitation patients (n=395) divided into two groups based on a history of prior work-related injury. The RI (n=172) group had at least one prior work-related injury claim (with or without lost time), whereas the nonrecurrent injury (NRI; n=223) group did not. Outcome measures: The RI and NRI groups were assessed for prospectively collected demographic, psychosocial and work history/adjustment data. A structured clinical interview addressing socioeconomic outcomes and assessing work return, health utilization, recurrent injury and case closure was administered 1 year after discharge from the treatment program. Methods: Consecutive patients from a regional referral center for tertiary rehabilitation treatment of chronic work-related musculoskeletal injuries were evaluated with a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment protocol at pretreatment and posttreatment. Moreover, at 1 year after completing the program, a structural telephone interview was conducted that assessed health and socioeconomic outcomes. Results: For the 1-year socioeconomic outcomes (such as posttreatment injury), the RI patients responded to rehabilitation at a level equivalent to the NRI patients. Demographic analyses revealed that RI patients, relative to NRI patients, were older, more represented by the dominant culture, had more education, had a shorter length of disability, had less severe types of injuries, had a greater rate of non-work-related health conditions, received higher disability payments, and had slightly greater job demand. The RI group also had a greater rate of pre-injury Axis I psychiatric disorders, particularly substance abuse/dependence disorders, than the NRI group. In addition, the RI group had greater job stability than the NRI group.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Systematic reviews have consistently shown that multidisciplinary interventions are more effective than waitlist and other unimodal active treatments for a range of chronic pain conditions. However, these group-based statistics fail to inform us whether these programs result in clinically meaningful improvement at the individual level. The current study examines group changes and individual responsiveness to a CBT-informed multidisciplinary chronic pain management program. METHODS: The analyses are based on data obtained from 263 outpatients. In addition to examining group-based treatment effects, we evaluated individual responsiveness to the program using 3 different criteria for assessing clinically important change. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvement was found for all measures at posttreatment, with effect sizes ranging from small to medium. Gains were largely maintained at follow-up. The results of the clinically important change analysis revealed that not everyone improved uniformly, and the magnitude of change varied across the 3 different methods. This variability in the extent of improvement prompted further analyses in an attempt to identify individual differences that could predict responsiveness to treatment. No differences were found between responders and nonresponders to treatment. DISCUSSION: The results of our study are consistent with previous research, and highlight the potential for multidisciplinary programs to improve the well-being of individuals with chronic pain. Clinically important change analyses underscore the variability that exists in chronic pain patients and allows for a more fine grained evaluation of individual responsiveness to treatment. Considering the strengths and limitations of each methodological approach for assessing clinically important change, guidelines are offered for future research and program development.

AB  - Background. Most fibromyalgia patients are seen in primary care (PC). However, the effectiveness of the treatments prescribed by general practitioners is usually minimal. The main objective of the present research is to assess the efficacy of structured psycho-educational intervention, combined with relaxation, developed to improve the quality of life of patients suffering fibromyalgia (FM). The second objective is to assess the cost-effectiveness of this multimodal intervention. Method/Design. Design. Randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up involving two groups, one of which is the intervention group that includes patients receiving a psychoeducational program and the other the control group consisting of patients treated for FM in the usual way. Setting. Three urban PC centers in the province of Barcelona (Spain). Sample. The total sample comprises 218 patients (over 18 years of age) suffering FM, selected from a database (Rheumatology service-Viladecans Hospital) of patients with this illness. Only those patients introduced in the database between the years 2005 and 2007 were included in the selection. Selected patients will be asked for written informed consent to participate in the study. Intervention. Multi-component program including information about the illness, counselling about physical exercise and training in autogenic relaxation. The intervention consists of nine 2-hour sessions delivered during a two-month period. The pharmacological treatment prescribed by the physician was maintained in both groups. Main variables. Sociodemographic characteristics, quality of life, use and cost of healthcare and social services. Measures. Quality of life is to be measured with the FIQ and the EuroQol-5D, and the use of healthcare services with an adapted version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI). These variables will be measured before the beginning of the program (baseline) and 1, 2, 6 and 12 months later. Discussion. This research project is an attempt to demonstrate that a psycho-educational program implemented in the context of PC can produce a significant increase in the quality of life for patients with FM, as well as a decrease in the use of healthcare and social services, compared with usual care.

AB  - The prevalence of work-related upper extremity disorders has significantly increased in the past decade. Persistent pain, loss of function, and associated work disability in patients with work-related upper extremity disorders appears to be affected by multiple factors including physical capabilities in relation to work demands, ergonomic risk factors on the job, and psychological factors related to worker traits, psychological readiness to return to work, and ability to manage symptoms. The complex nature of these disorders suggests the utility of a multidisciplinary program targeted at these factors. The present study is an investigation of the long-term vocational outcome of a multicomponent rehabilitation program that includes physical conditioning, work conditioning, work-related pain and stress management, ergonomic consultation, and vocational counseling/placement. Two groups equivalent on measures of duration of work disability, pain severity, fear of reinjury, psychological distress, perceived work environment, age, and education level were exposed to either the comprehensive work rehabilitation intervention (n = 19) or usual care (n = 15). Return-to-work status was determined at an average of 17 months posttreatment (range, 3 to 35 months) for the treatment group and an average of 18 months postevaluation (range, 5 to 30 months) for the usual care group. Findings indicated that 74% of the treatment group returned to work or were involved in state-supported vocational training in contrast to 40% of the control group (P < .05). For those who returned to work, 91% of the treatment group were working full-time in contrast to 50% of the control group (P < .05). Although the treatment group demonstrated a higher return-to-work rate than controls, the work reentry rate was not as high as similar approaches with work-related low back pain (80% to 88% return-to-work rate). These findings suggest the need to modify treatment components to facilitate an increased return-to-work rate. Areas that may prove useful include a greater emphasis ergonomic modifications at the workplace to reduce the risks of repetitiveness, force, awkward posture, and insufficient work/rest cycles, as well as efforts to modify work style directly in order to reduce the impact of ergonomic stressors on the ability to perform essential job tasks. In combination with traditional work hardening efforts directed at improving strength and flexibility of the upper extremities and work-related pain and stress management training, these ergonomic and work-style modification efforts may contribute to increases in the percentage of work disabled cases who successfully return to competitive work.

AB  - Objectives. Smoking may be a major problem in chronic low back pain (LBP) patients. The goal of this study was to determine whether smoking status affected multidisciplinary pain facility treatment outcome. Design. As part of a grant study, chronic LBP patients identified themselves as either current smokers (N=81) or current nonsmokers (N=140), and were compared by chi-square for employment status at 1, 6, 12, and 24months after multidisciplinary pain facility treatment. Smokers who were unemployed at each time interval were then compared with employed smokers for a large number of assessment scales and clinical variables of interest by chi-square or Student's t -test. The significant independent variables from these analyses were then utilized in a logistic regression to determine predictors for smoker nonemployment. Setting. Pain facility. Results. Current smokers were less likely to be employed at each follow-up time point. Pain levels over the previous 24hours predicted employment status for current smokers at 1-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up, while worker compensation status predicted employment status at 6months. Conclusions. Current smoking status appears to be associated with poorer treatment outcome after multidisciplinary pain facility treatment. Return to work within smokers is predicted by pain and worker compensation status. Pain facilities should target current smokers with significant perceived pain for close treatment monitoring in an attempt to improve treatment outcome. © 2008 by American Academy of Pain Medicine.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a feasibility and efficacy trial of mindfulness therapy in somatization disorder and functional somatic syndromes such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome, defined as bodily distress syndrome (BDS). Methods: We randomized 119 patients to either mindfulness therapy (mindfulness-based stress reduction and some cognitive behavioral therapy elements for BDS) or to enhanced treatment as usual (2-hour specialist medical care and brief cognitive behavioral therapy for BDS). The primary outcome measure was change in physical health (SF-36 Physical Component Summary) from baseline to 15-month follow-up. Results: The study is negative as we could not demonstrate a different development over time for the two groups (F(3,2674)=1.51, P = .21). However, in the mindfulness therapy group, improvement was obtained toward the end of treatment and it remained present at the 15-month follow-up, whereas the enhanced treatment as usual group achieved no significant change until 15-month follow-up. The change scores averaged half a standard deviation which amounts to a clinically significant change, 29% changed more than 1 standard deviation. Significant between-group differences were observed at treatment cessation. Conclusion: Mindfulness therapy is a feasible and acceptable treatment. The study showed that mindfulness therapy was comparable to enhanced treatment as usual in improving quality of life and symptoms. Nevertheless, considering the more rapid improvement following mindfulness, mindfulness therapy may be a potentially useful intervention in BDS patients. Clinically important changes that seem to be comparable to a CBT treatment approach were obtained. Further research is needed to replicate or even expand these findings.

AB  - Study Design. This is secondary research examining the longitudinal mediation effect within a structural equation model. Objective. To identify possible mechanisms that mediate the effects of a cognitive behavioral approach upon disability and pain in low back pain patients. Summary of Background Data. Cognitive behavioral interventions (CBIs) can improve pain and disability in low back pain (LBP) but the mechanisms of action are unclear. We used data from a large randomized controlled trial to investigate mediators of the treatment effect of CBI. Methods. Pain self-efficacy, fear avoidance, and physical and mental functioning were selected as candidate mediators based on the theoretical rationale of the intervention. The primary treatment outcomes were the Roland Morris Questionnaire (RMDQ) and the modified Von Korff scale (MVK pain and disability) at 12 months. We used structural equation models to estimate the contribution of mediators. All models were tested for goodness-of-fit using chi 2, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index, and Bentler Comparative Fit Index. Results. We included 701 adults with LBP. The average RMDQ score at baseline for those on the intervention arm was 8.8 (Standard Deviation 5.0). The intervention was effective in reducing disability and pain at 12 months. Change in mental functioning was not a significant mediator. Changes to pain self-efficacy, fear avoidance, and physical functioning were causal mediators of the treatment effect at 12 months (RMDQ b= -0.149, P<0.001; MVK-pain b=-0.181, P<0.001 and MVK-disability b=-0.180, P<0.001). Overall, the SEM model exceeded the threshold for acceptable goodness-of-fit. Conclusion. Fear avoidance and self-efficacy were important causal mediators of the cognitive behavioral treatment effect. Self-assessed change in physical function was a causal mediator but mental functioning was not. This suggests people need to experience meaningful change in physical function and beliefs but not in mental functioning associated with LBP, to achieve a treatment benefit.

AB  - Follow-up visits by clinical nurse specialists are beneficial for patients with various chronic conditions. It is unknown whether patients with chronic nonmalignant pain can achieve similar benefit. The aim of this study was to assess outcomes of follow-up visits by clinical nurse specialists to chronic nonmalignant pain patients regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL), pain, opioid treatment, quality of sleep, and depression. A total of 102 patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled trial during a 2-year period after discharge from multidisciplinary pain treatment and randomized to intervention or control group. Intervention group patients (n = 52) received home visits every fourth month for 2 years. The findings showed that HRQoL improved generally more in the intervention group. Statistically significant improvements were observed for physical function and bodily pain. Whereas the intervention group maintained the pain level on a visual analog scale, the control group reported more pain. During the observation period, the control group increased dosage of opioids whereas the intervention group maintained stable dosage. No significant effect on quality of life was found. Nurses identified signs of depression in 80% of their patients scoring depression on the simultaneous depression questionnaire, and thereby could refer patients to early treatment. Follow-up visits by clinical nurse specialists appeared to offer positive benefits to patients with chronic nonmalignant pain after discharge from multidisciplinary pain treatment. The intervention improved physical functioning, reduced bodily pain and pain intensity and prevented opioid dosage increase. Most episodes of depression were identified and referred to relevant treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this longitudinal prospective study was to assess the clinical benefits of a newly established functional restoration programme for patients with chronic low back pain. The overall aim of the programme was to improve function and encourage patients to take a more active role in their own management. One hundred and twenty-nine patients with chronic low back pain attended an outpatient functional restoration programme between February 1994 and March 1997. They were assessed using a battery of functional and psychological outcome measures before treatment, immediately after treatment, and at 7, 15, 27 and 55 weeks after inclusion. There was a high prevalence of psychological distress prior to treatment. At 55 weeks after treatment, effect size scores for measures of disability, psychological distress and depression were small to moderate (Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability index 0.23, General Health Questionnaire 0.46, Zung depression 0.47, pain self-efficacy 0.6); and scores for walking distance were large (1.2). To date, the effectiveness of functional restoration programmes has not been properly assessed in the. United Kingdom, and although the results of this study seem positive enough to justify the programme, randomised controlled trials are necessary to assess clinical and cost effectiveness.

AB  - QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: Chronic pain has a high impact on individuals and society. (Cost-)effective interventions are desperately needed. We evaluated short- and long-term effects of the Bern Ambulatory Interprofessional Rehabilitation (BAI-Reha) for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: We analysed data prospectively collected from patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain before and after BAI-Reha (at 12 weeks, 1 year and 2 years) using linear mixed-models and logistic generalised estimating equations. RESULTS: The first thirty consecutive patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, aged between 20 and 73 years (mean 44.83, standard deviation 12.57 years) were included. We found significant changes over time compared with baseline for return to work (p <0.001), Euro quality of life visual analogue scale score (p = 0.026), burden of suffering (p = 0.001), self-rated and observed quality of daily life task motor performance (p <0.001 and p = 0.012, respectively) but not for pain intensity (p = 0.16) and observed quality of daily life task process performance (p = 0.28). At the first postintervention visit we found significant differences compared with baseline in return to work (odds ratio 5.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80-15.39], burden of suffering (mean difference 5.26, 95% CI 2.09-8.44], self-rated quality (mean difference 2.31, 95% CI 1.57-3.05) and satisfaction (mean difference 2.80, 95% CI 1.95-3.66) with daily life task performance, and observed quality with daily life task motor performance (mean difference 0.31, 95% CI 0.02-0.60). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms earlier data and supports the effectiveness of interprofessional rehabilitation for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

AB  - Chronic pain related to musculoskeletal conditions is the leading cause of medical discharge from active duty military service. The present study is the first randomized controlled trial of an interdisciplinary pain treatment program (functional restoration, FR) to decrease chronic musculoskeletal pain and increase functioning in an active duty military population. Sixty-six military participants were randomly assigned to either an FR treatment group or a standard anesthesia pain clinic treatment comparison group. A repeated measures design was employed and data were analyzed for pre- to post-treatment differences, as well as for 6-months and 1-year post-treatment outcomes. Findings revealed significantly greater improvements for the FR group on self-reported pain, disability, functional status, and fitness for military duty at the post-treatment and follow-up points, relative to the comparison group. These results clearly demonstrate the efficacy and military relevance of a FR program for active duty military personnel who have chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For patients with chronic pain, the heterogeneity of clinical presentations makes it difficult to identify patients who would benefit from multimodal rehabilitation programs (MMRP). Yet, there is limited knowledge regarding the predictors of MMRP's outcomes. This study identifies predictors of outcome of MMRPs at a 12-month follow-up (FU-12) based on data from the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation (SQRP). METHODS: Patients with chronic pain from two clinical departments in Sweden completed the SQRP questionnaires-background, pain characteristics, psychological symptoms, function, activity/participation, health and quality of life-on three occasions: 1) during their first visit; 2) immediately after the completion of their MMRP; and 3) 12 months after completing the MMRP (n = 227). During the FU-12, the patients also retrospectively reported their global impressions of any changes in their perception of pain and their ability to handle their life situation in general. RESULTS: Significant improvements were found for pain, psychological symptoms, activity/participation, health, and quality of life aspects with low/medium strong effects. A general pattern was observed from the analyses of the changes from baseline to FU-12; the largest improvements in outcomes were significantly associated with poor situations according to their respective baseline scores. Although significant regressors of the investigated outcomes were found, the significant predictors were weak and explained a minor part of the variation in outcomes (15-25%). At the FU-12, 53.6% of the patients reported that their pain had decreased and 80.1% reported that their life situation in general had improved. These improvements were associated with high education, low pain intensity, high health level, and work importance (only pain perception). The explained variations were low (9-11%). CONCLUSIONS: Representing patients in real-world clinical settings, this study confirmed systematic reviews that outcomes of MMRP are associated with broad positive effects. A mix of background and baseline variables influenced the outcomes investigated, but the explained variations in outcomes were low. There is still a need to develop standardized and relatively simple outcomes that can be used to evaluate MMRP in trials, in clinical evaluations at group level, and for individual patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Embedded behavioral medicine services are a common component of multidisciplinary chronic pain treatment programs. However, few studies have studied whether these services are associated with improved treatment outcomes. METHOD(S): Using a retrospective, matched, two-cohort study design, we examined patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System pain, mental health, and physical function measures, collected at every clinic visit in every patient. Changes from baseline through 12months were compared in those receiving embedded Behavioral Medicine in addition to usual care to a Standard Care group seen in the same pain practice and weighted via propensity scoring. RESULT(S): At baseline, Behavioral Medicine patients had worse scores on most pain, mental health, and physical health measures and were more likely to be female, a member of a racial minority, and have lower socioeconomic status. Regardless of having a worse clinical pain syndrome at baseline, at follow-up both Behavioral Medicine (N=451) and Standard Care patients (N=8,383) showed significant and comparable improvements in pain intensity, physical function, depression, and sleep disturbance. Behavioral Medicine patients showed significantly greater improvements in their global impressions of change than the Standard Care patients. CONCLUSION(S): Despite worse pain and physical and psychological functioning at baseline, Behavioral Medicine patients showed improvements comparable to patients not receiving these services. Further, Behavioral Medicine patients report higher global impressions of change, indicating that embedded mental health services appear to have the additive value of amplifying the benefits of multimodal pain care.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Pain Medicine.

AB  - Evaluates the effectiveness of a pain management programme in reducing self-reported pain within the overall context of improvements in quality of life. 65 patients aged 24â€“75 yrs completed the SF36 Health Survey Questionnaire. Logistical and methodological problems in evaluating self-reported pain are discussed. The results at discharge show a statistically significant reduction in reported pain for the group as a whole and a clinically relevant improvement in 53.8% of patients. These benefits are maintained up to 1-yr follow-up, which suggests that pain management programmes should not abandon the attempt to reduce self-reported pain.

AB  - Evaluated the 2-yr outcome of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for patients with prolonged musculoskeletal disorders (mean age 44.3 yrs), in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQL) and working ability. In addition, predictors of outcome were examined. The rehabilitation group and the matched control group comprised 122 and 114 patients respectively. Baseline data were compared with 2-yr follow-up data within and between the groups. The variables that were measured were: HRQL, motivation, body awareness, pain, pain-related medicine consumption, psychosomatic symptoms, working environment and working ability. Variables which improved significantly for the rehabilitation group compared with the control group were HRQL, emotional reactions, pain related to movements and need for pain-related medicines. Multivariate regression analysis including all patients revealed that motivation was a predictor of change in HRQL and working ability. The rehabilitation program appeared to improve HRQL to a greater extent than ordinary treatment available within primary care. The patient's level of motivation could be an important predictor of outcome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: Treatment options for chronic low back pain (CLBP) include cognitive behavioral interventions. Most of these interventions only have small and short-lived effects. Using strict inclusion criteria for participation in an intensive combined physical and psychological program, encouraging effects were reported at 1-year follow-up. This study evaluates the long-term follow-up results of the same program. The hypothesis is that previously reported results are maintained. Method(s): Structured interviews were conducted in a prospective extended cohort with a minimum of 5-year follow-up in a similar fashion as in the 1-year follow-up report. The median follow-up in this cohort was 6.5 years. The extended cohort consisted of 277 patients (85% response). Result(s): Outcomes include daily functioning, quality of life, current pain intensity, pain disturbance in daily activities and indicators of the use of pain medication and healthcare services. The previously reported positive 1-year follow-up results were maintained at a minimum of 5-year follow-up. Disability as measured with the Oswestry disability index (ODIv2.1a) decreased from 40 to 27 in the first year. This positive result was maintained at the 6.5-year follow-up with an ODI of 28. Pain intensity (NRS 0-100) improved from 60 to 39 in the first year, and at 6.5 years, this had further improved to 33. Improvement in quality of life (SF 36) at 1-year follow-up was maintained at 6.5-year follow-up, and healthcare consumption had decreased substantially as measured with doctor visits and analgesics used for CLBP. Conclusion(s): Selected and motivated patients with longstanding CLBP improve fast after an intensive combined physical and psychological program in daily functioning, pain and quality of life. Positive 1-year results are maintained, and healthcare utilization was still reduced at a minimum of 5-year follow-up.

AB  - The long-term efficacy of a multidisciplinary pain management center was evaluated by comparing 20 treated patients (mean age at baseline 42.35 yrs) with 20 no-treatment control patients (mean age 43.1 yrs) who met the program's entrance criteria, wanted to participate, but could not because they did not have insurance coverage. Follow-up pain questionnaires included the Visual Analogue Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. At 1â€“5 yrs follow-up, 60% of the treated Ss met all of the criteria for success established by A. H. Roberts and L. Reinhardt (1980), while none of the untreated Ss did so. Treated Ss reported less interference with activities, more 'uptime,' lower pain levels, less depression, and fewer hospitalizations than untreated patients. Also, more treated Ss reported being employed, while fewer used either narcotic or psychotropic medications at follow-up compared to untreated Ss. Pretreatment-to-follow-up changes are reported for both the treated and untreated groups as well as for 57 treated Ss who responded to the questionnaire but were not included in the initial comparison.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation of low back pain patients in a multidisciplinary setting. Design: A retrospective study profiled and analysed objective data from patients seen through a rehabilitation program in a private multidisciplinary facility. Patients: 147 patients with low back pain were analysed. Population: The sample consisted mainly of patients with motor vehicle accident-related or work-related injuries to the lower back. They ranged from acute to chronic in nature. Main outcome measures: The primary measures were the Oswestry Pain Disability Index (ODI) and the Pain Visual Analogue Scale. Secondary measures included SLR, sit and reach test, grip strength, leg lift strength and ranges of motion. Results: The outcome measures used in the study showed statistical significance (p < 0. 05). Positive clinical trends were shown in pain VAS, ODI, leg lift and sit and reach tests. Ninety percent of patients were cleared to return to work upon discharge from the program. Conclusions: Further studies of active physical rehabilitation should employ a prospective randomized controlled trial design. The study should also follow up patients to confirm that they have continued to work following discharge from the program. As indicated by the statistical analysis provided by this study, a minimum sample size of 53 subjects per intervention group would be required.

AB  - The present study sought to evaluate the efficacy of a 12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme mainly emphasizing physiotherapy, for patients with either fibromyalgia syndrome or chronic, widespread pain. Forty-three non-randomized female patients with fibromyalgia syndrome or chronic, widespread pain were assigned to the programme or served as waiting-list controls. The outcome was assessed with the Body Awareness Scale-Health, the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, the Quality of Life Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale and a pain drawing. Both groups were reassessed after 3 and 6 months, the treatment group also after 1 year. The treatment group improved in quality of movement and in vegetative disturbances according to the Body Awareness Scale-Health after the programme. At the 3-month and 1-year follow-ups the improvements were partly sustained. The control group showed deterioration after 3 and 6 months in three of the main scales of the Body Awareness Scale-Health. This clinical trial of a rehabilitation programme, proved beneficial for improving quality of movement and reducing the experience of vegetative disturbances.

AB  - Introduction. The efficacy of functional restoration programs for the treatment of chronic back pain is well documented. Nevertheless, there are only a few such centres in Germany and few trials have been conducted in German-speaking regions to demonstrate that implementing such programs in everyday clinical settings with large numbers of patients is just as effective as in a research setting. The present study examined whether the positive effects of such programs can also be observed in the clinically relevant context of a standardized day clinic treatment regimen.Material and methods. A total of 681 back pain patients in 2 German cities were examined at 4 measurement points (before and immediately after the program, as well as 6 and 12 months after treatment) using a comprehensive questionnaire on perceived pain and symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as the work situation.Results. In both cities significant and long-term improvements in back pain, pain-related impairment and degree of chronification were observed, as well as a high return-to-work rate after treatment. Hence, the quality of such programs was also confirmed for a large patient population. © Deutsche Schmerzgesellschaft e.V. Published by Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg - all rights reserved 2013.

AB  - Examined the effects of various screening methods and treatments on return to work of individuals with longlasting musculoskeletal pain, and relevant cost–benefits issues. 654 individuals (mean ages 43–44 yrs) sick-listed for 8+ wks were categorized as having a good, medium, or poor prognosis for returning to work, then underwent 1 of the 3 outpatient treatments of ordinary, light multidisciplinary, and extensive multidisciplinary treatment. Collected data included employment status at 14-mo follow-up. Results show that Ss with good prognosis for return to work did equally well with ordinary treatment as with the more intensive treatments. Those Ss with medium prognosis benefitted equally from the 2 multidisciplinary treatments. Ss with poor prognosis and receiving extensive multidisciplinary treatment returned to work at a higher rate than did Ss receiving ordinary treatment. Light and extensive multidisciplinary treatment programs yielded positive cost benefits. It is concluded that a simple, standardized screening instrument including only psychological and physiotherapeutic observations is a useful clinical tool for allocating patients with musculoskeletal pain to the most appropriate level of treatment.

AB  - Low back pain patients (n = 142) on sick leave for at least 8 weeks were given a multi-modal cognitive behavioural treatment program (MMCBT) that lasted for 4 weeks. Before treatment, all patients were tested with a comprehensive test battery. The outcome at 12-month follow-up was predictable from the pretest, but only when combining medical and psychological data. Patients who returned to work (Returners, 50%) in the MMCBT group were characterised by less pain, more psychological strength, were evaluated by the physiotherapist as having a good prognosis for return to work, and were less educated. Patients who did not return to work (Non-returners) in the MMCBT group felt tense and unfit, felt hopelessness concerning the future, were less physically active, thought their complaints would worsen if they continued working, and reported fewer difficulties driving a car. Returners to work (58%) in the randomised control group (n = 81), who received ordinary physical therapy, were characterised by high levels of energy, less subjective health complaints, less exhaustion for a condition test, and did not work in positions giving a constant load on the back. There was no significant differences between number of patients who had returned to work in the MMCBT and the control group. Non-returners in the control group lacked energy, trained less regularly, worked in occupations that gave an almost constant load on the back, and did not expect to be back to work in the course of a couple of weeks. It seems to be important to develop further diagnostic tools to identify those who might benefit from extensive or specific treatments.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify predictors for return to work for chronic low back pain patients (n = 76) on sick leave for more than 8 weeks. After examination with a battery of medical and psychological tests, the patients participated in a modified functional restoration program lasting from 6 to 8 hours per day for 3 weeks. The treatment aimed at increasing the physical function and influencing attitudes to pain by active physical training, group discussions, and education. At 12-month follow-up sick leave status, according to the insurance registers, showed that 55 (72%) patients had returned to work. Significant predictors for not returning to work were high physical work load and number of children, yielding a classification accuracy of 85%. The predictors from this study differs from previous findings of predictors for a light mobilization program for low back pain. The predictor model seem to be specific to treatment and patient selection.

AB  - Background and aims: Pain is one of the most common reasons for patients to seek primary health care. Pain relief is likely to be achieved for patients suffering from acute pain, but for individuals with chronic pain it is more likely that the condition will persist. These patients have the option of being referred to specialised pain clinics. However, the complexity surrounding chronic pain patients is not well studied in these settings. This study aimed to describe patients with chronic pain referred to a pain clinic by using the information submitted during their first visit and one year later and also to identify associations between baseline characteristics and improvements in health-related quality of life in the follow-up. Methods: This was a longitudinal observational study of a sample consisting of 318 patients referred to a pain clinic. One group of patients containing 271 individuals (median age 48, 64% females) was assessed and received conventional pain treatment (CPT group) and a second group of 47 patients (median age 53, 64% females) was assessed by a pain specialist and referred back to their physician with a treatment recommendation (assessment only, AO group). Patient-reported outcome measures in health-related quality of life (EQ-5D), pain intensity (VAS), mental health (HADS), insomnia (ISI), pain-related disability (PDI), kinesiophobia (TSK) and sense of coherence (SOC) were collected at the first visit and one year later. Results: At baseline, the CPT group reported a low EQ-5D Index (median (md) 0.157) and EQ VAS (md 40) as well as considerable high, current pain intensity VAS (md 58), HADS anxiety (md 8), ISI (md 17), PDI (md 36) and TSK (md 39). The AO group showed similar problems (no significant differences compared to the CPT group), except for ISI, where the AO group reported less severe problems. At the one-year follow-up, the CPT group had a statistically significant improvement in EQ-5D, VAS, ISI, PDI and TSK. In the AO group no significant changes were observed. In the CPT group there was an association between a high ISI level at baseline and an improved EQ-5D Index in the follow-up. Conclusions: The study describes rarely explored groups of patients with chronic pain at a pain clinic. Severe pain problems were present in both groups at their first visit. A statistically significant improvement could be seen in the group that was conventionally treated while this was not the case among those subjects who were assessed and referred. The results imply, that relatively limited treatment strategies were helpful for the patients' health-related quality of life. Despite these improvements, the patients were not fully recovered, pointing to the chronicity of pain conditions and the need of support for many patients. Implications: Increased knowledge about assessment, selection and treatment at pain clinics is important to improve the quality of the work performed at these clinics. Despite limited resources, further efforts should be made to collect comparable, valid data on a regular base from pain clinics in order to develop recommendation models., Copyright Â© 2016 Scandinavian Association for the Study of Pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Multimodal rehabilitation (MMR) programmes, including, physical training, educational and psychological interventions by an interdisciplinary team are found to be more successful for patients with disabling chronic pain compared with less comprehensive treatments. MMR programmes are based on the biopsychosocial model and the goal is usually to improve function, quality of life and facilitate and enable return to work. As pain clinics traditionally offer conventional medical pain treatment, there is limited knowledge about MMR given in this context. The aim of our study was to describe characteristics of patients with chronic pain, treated with a MMR programme at a conventional pain clinic, to evaluate patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) from start to one year after, and to study possibly associated factors for the improvement of health-related quality of life after one year. METHODS: A prospective, observational study with a one-year follow-up was performed. SUBJECTS: A total of 42 individuals (38 females, age 44.0+/-12.3 years and 4 men age 40+/-8.5 years) with different pain diagnoses were included. After a team assessment, the patients began a programme that lasted about three months. The MMR programme contained coordinated, individually adapted treatments administered individually or in groups, and was based on cognitive behavioural principles. Questionnaires regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (EQ-5D), insomnia (ISI), mental health (HADS), pain-related disability (PDI), kinesiophobia (TSK), current pain intensity (VAS) and sense of coherence (SOC) were used at the start of the MMR and at follow-up. Demographic data were collected from the patient records. RESULTS: The PROM at baseline showed substantial pain problems with low HRQoL (EQ-5D index of 0.1+/-0.282, and EQ VAS of 32.67+/-20.1), moderate insomnia (ISI 18.95+/-6.7), doubtful cases of depression and anxiety (HADS-depression 9.35+/-4.1 and HADS-anxiety 9.78+/-3.95), presence of pain-related disability (PDI 39.48 +/-12.64), kinesiophobia (TSK 40.8+/-9.8), as well as moderate current pain (VAS 61.31+/-20.4). The sense of coherence was weak (SOC of 51.37+/-14). At one-year follow-up, significant (p</=0.05) improvement occurred on the EQ-5D index, EQ VAS, ISI, PDI and TSK. In the logistic regression analysis, no significant associations could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: MMR for patients with complex pain problems can be a successful treatment alternative at conventional pain clinics. IMPLICATIONS: Since access to rehabilitation clinics in Sweden may be limited, the availability of MMR can increase by providing this type of intervention in pain clinics. Increased knowledge of MMR in different settings can also contribute to increased understanding and collaboration between pain clinics and rehabilitation units.

AB  - Beneficial effects on psychological measures in orthopedic inpatient rehabilitation of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and co-existing depressive symptoms have been shown only for multidisciplinary approaches that incorporate psychotherapeutic interventions. Aim of this study was to verify these findings for pain coping outcomes (pain-related psychological disability, pain-related coping). Short-, mid-, and long-term effects of a standard pain management program that was either solely provided or combined with a supplemental cognitive-behavioral depression management were examined in a consecutive sample of n=84. Patients in both groups showed long-term beneficial effects in pain coping measures. Thus, the standard rehabilitation revealed specific and long-term effects on pain coping. However, further evidence suggests that diagnosis-specific psychotherapeutic treatment elements are required to improve psychological symptoms. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.

AB  - Psychological factors have been found to be of major importance for the transition from acute to chronic low back pain (CLBP). Although some evidence has been provided that depressive symptoms occur secondarily to CLBP, psychological treatment modules that specifically address depressive symptoms are not yet included in German inpatient rehabilitation programs. In this study, a standard rehabilitation program for patients with CLBP and depressive symptoms was compared to a standard rehabilitation, into which a cognitive-behavioral management training of depressive symptoms was integrated. Moreover, treatment effects of this multidisciplinary standard rehabilitation program delivered to patients with either no or only mild depressive symptoms were investigated. As a further aim of the present study, gender effects on rehabilitation outcomes were examined. Short-, mid-, and long-term effects on individual global improvement as well as pain-related, psychological, and work-related measures were evaluated among N = 199 consecutively admitted patients with CLBP, aged from 24 to 62 years. The standard rehabilitation program had no persisting effects on psychological outcomes among patients with no and mild depressive symptoms. Patients with moderate and severe depressive symptoms in the standard rehabilitation program did not benefit with clinical importance at the 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments, but did show clinically significant improvements in psychological outcome measures at the 6-month follow-up assessment when the supplemental psychological component was applied. Additionally, days of sick leave decreased in the intervention group in the mid-term when compared to the baseline. Females benefited more in mental health than males. However, due to regression effects at the 12-month follow-up assessment, booster sessions are highly recommended. The results presented here support the notion that a more adequately tailored rehabilitation program seems to improve rehabilitation success and prevent further development of CLBP among this high-risk subpopulation. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients suffer from chronic neck pain following a whiplash injury. A combination of cognitive, behavioural therapy with physiotherapy interventions has been indicated to be effective in the management of patients with chronic whiplash-associated disorders. The objective is to present the design of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a combined individual physical and cognitive behavioural-graded activity program on self-reported general physical function, in addition to neck function, pain, disability and quality of life in patients with chronic neck pain following whiplash injury compared with a matched control group measured at baseline and 4 and 12 months after baseline. METHODS/DESIGN: The design is a two-centre, RCT-study with a parallel group design. Included are whiplash patients with chronic neck pain for more than 6 months, recruited from physiotherapy clinics and an out-patient hospital department in Denmark. Patients will be randomised to either a pain management (control) group or a combined pain management and training (intervention)group. The control group will receive four educational sessions on pain management, whereas the intervention group will receive the same educational sessions on pain management plus 8 individual training sessions for 4 months, including guidance in specific neck exercises and an aerobic training programme. Patients and physiotherapists are aware of the allocation and the treatment, while outcome assessors and data analysts are blinded. The primary outcome measures will be Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF36), Physical Component Summary (PCS). Secondary outcomes will be Global Perceived Effect (-5 to +5), Neck Disability Index (0-50), Patient Specific Functioning Scale (0-10), numeric rating scale for pain bothersomeness (0-10), SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS), TAMPA scale of Kinesiophobia (17-68), Impact of Event Scale (0-45), EuroQol (0-1), craniocervical flexion test (22 mmHg - 30 mmHg), joint position error test and cervical range of movement. The SF36 scales are scored using norm-based methods with PCS and MCS having a mean score of 50 with a standard deviation of 10. DISCUSSION: The perspectives of this study are discussed, in addition to the strengths and weaknesses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered in http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01431261.

AB  - Chronic disabling occupational musculoskeletal pain disorder (CDOMPD) patients often have high levels of somatization, a phenomenon in which somatic symptoms are medically unexplainable. Examination of 1,458 CDOMPD patients, who completed the patient health questionnaire (PHQ) somatization module from 2003 to 2010 and underwent functional restoration treatment, were divided into low, moderate, and high somatization at pretreatment. Somatization was highly responsive to treatment, and those with high somatization reported the highest depressive symptoms, disability, and pain intensity, and the lowest health-related quality of life at pre- and post-treatment. Somatization levels significantly predicted 1-year socioeconomic outcomes of work return, work retention, and healthcare utilization. High somatization may act as a 'red flag' for clinicians, indicating patients may be at risk for poor treatment outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - STUDY DESIGN.: A retrospective study of prospectively collected data. OBJECTIVE.: To determine whether comorbid fibromyalgia, identified in patients with chronic disabling occupational musculoskeletal disorders (CDOMDs), resolves with a functional restoration program (FRP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Fibromyalgia involves widespread bodily pain and tenderness to palpation. In recent studies, 23% to 41% of patients with CDOMDs entering an FRP had comorbid fibromyalgia, compared with population averages of 2% to 5%. Few studies have examined whether fibromyalgia diagnoses resolve with any treatment, and none have investigated diagnosis responsiveness to an FRP. METHODS.: A consecutive cohort of patients with CDOMDs (82% with spinal disorders and all reporting chronic spinal pain) and comorbid fibromyalgia (N = 117) completed an FRP, which included quantitatively directed exercise progression and multimodal disability management. Diagnosis responsiveness, evaluated at discharge, created 2 groups: those who retained fibromyalgia and those who did not. These groups were compared with chronic regional lumbar pain only patients (LO group, n = 87), lacking widespread pain and fibromyalgia. RESULTS.: Of the patients with comorbid fibromyalgia, 59% (n = 69) retained the fibromyalgia diagnosis (RFM group) and 41% (n = 48) lost the fibromyalgia diagnosis (LFM group) at discharge. Although all 3 groups reported decreased pain intensity, disability, and depressive symptoms from admission to discharge, RFM patients reported higher symptom levels than the LFM and LO groups at discharge. The LFM and LO groups were statistically similar. At 1-year follow-up, LO patients demonstrated higher work retention than both fibromyalgia groups (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION.: Despite a significant comorbid fibromyalgia prevalence in a cohort of patients with CDOMDs entering an FRP, 41% of patients with an initial fibromyalgia diagnosis no longer met diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia at discharge and were indistinguishable from LO patients on pain, disability, and depression symptoms. However, both fibromyalgia groups (LFM and RFM) had lower work retention than LO patients 1 year later, suggesting that an FRP may suppress symptoms of fibromyalgia in a subset of patients, but prolonged fibromyalgia-related disability may be more difficult to overcome. © 2014, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Describes a randomized controlled study exploring the effects of a group learning pain intervention program based on a phenomenological epistemology and personal construct theory. Main outcome measures were experienced pain, pain coping strategies, absenteeism, disability pension, and health care consumption. 121 patients (aged 20-69 yrs; social insurance personnel with chronic musculoskeletal pain and high absenteeism) were included. The intervention group of 77 consisted of 9 groups of 6â€“10 people who were counseled by health personnel with special training. The learning program emphasized awareness, possible relations between bodily symptoms, emotions, mind and life situation, and change of focus from pain and disability to resources and potentials. One yr after the end of the learning program (T3), patients in the intervention group reported significant pain reduction, increased pain-coping abilities and a higher reduction of health care consumption than the control group. Absenteeism was not significantly reduced compared to the control group, but there were fewer persons receiving disability pension in the intervention group at T3 (38% vs 59%). This group-learning program should be considered an important adjunct to the therapy of patients with chronic muscular pain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: Characterize factors influencing the long-term return to activity (professional and recreational) for chronic low back pain by participating in a program of intensive functional rehabilitation training (RT) for low back pain. Method: Prospective study of 79 patients who have been contacted again more than 2 years after their RT program. Patients were re-interviewed from 2 to 10 years after their RT program about professional activities, leisure, their disabilities and psychological state. Results: The recovery rate of long-term occupation is 86%. Half of the patients retained the same activity while the other half had to change careers. Improving physical parameters does not determine the professional resumption, unlike anxiety levels (at day 0 and day 21) and depression (at day 0 and day 21) and Quebec score (at day 0). Seventy-four percent of patients have a long-term leisure activity. The identified prognostic factors are different: Sorensen scores (at day 0, differential), FABQ2 at day 21, and change VAS mobilization. Conclusion: For the design of the initial management of patients, our study shows the importance that should be attached to the psychosocial approach in the RT program.

AB  - Patients with chronic disabling low-back pain have poor prospects of returning to work. The authors tested a treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support through 1 year prospective observation of patients disabled for an average of 19 months without evidence of surgically correctable disease. Ninety patients were studied: 59 program graduates, five program dropouts, 17 patients denied program authorization by their insurance carriers, and six crossover patients. Three patients were admitted but refused to participate in the treatment program. Initial demographic, physical and self-assessment attributes were similar for all four groups. At year's end, 81% of program graduates, 40% of the dropouts, and 29% of those denied the program had returned to work. All six crossover patients were working 6 months after treatment. Program graduates showed significant improvements in self-assessed pain, disability, and depression, and in physical capacities after 3 weeks of treatment. These improvements were maintained through the year except for partial decreases in frequent lifting, cycling endurance, and isokinetic trunk extension strength. Functional restoration with behavioral support is an effective treatment for patients with chronic, disabling low-back pain, as measured by self-assessments, physical capacities, and return to work.

AB  - Introduction: The empirical findings on risk factors for a favorable/unfavorable outcome upraised via pain intensity, disability and functional capacity after empirically well-evaluated multimodal treatment are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to analyze the relevance of psychosocial and pain-related variables for therapeutic outcome in an unselected sample of patients with chronic non-specific back pain (CBP). Methods: Included were 681 patients with CBP referred to an outpatient-based multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation program and 320 took part in a survey 12 months later. Before, directly after and 12 months after the program the patients received a questionnaire which contained pain-related items on pain intensity, disability, self-reported functional capacity which were defined as outcome variables, psychological items (anxiety, depression) and work-related items which represented probable predictor variables. Multivariable regression analyses were calculated to estimate the contribution of the selected parameters on pain intensity, disability and functional capacity. Results: The calculated regressions showed only a moderate ability to predict or explain the outcomes pain intensity, disability and functional capacity. However, depression and body mass index (BMI) were significantly related to pain-related therapeutic outcome. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of chronic non-malignant pain in developed countries is high, ranging from 14% to 50%. Patients with chronic pain are active users of health-care services and they report impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) when compared with the general population. Psychological distress has been identified as one of the risk factors for pain chronicity. Depression, anxiety and negative beliefs are associated with pain interference and perceived disability. Multidisciplinary pain management (MPM) aims to rehabilitating chronic pain patients by addressing both physical, psychological, social and occupational factors related to the pain problem. MPM programmes have been shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in patients with diverse chronic pain states. However, MPM programmes are often heterogeneous and predicting MPM treatment results in different patients groups may be difficult. Methods: The present study examined changes in HRQoL after MPM in 439 patients treated at a multidisciplinary pain clinic using the 15D HRQoL questionnaire. The characteristics of the 100 patients with the greatest improvement and the 100 patients with the largest decrease in HRQoL were examined more closely (demographics, characteristics of pain, pain interference, psychiatric comorbidity, employment status, details of MPM) after answering a follow-up 15D questionnaire at three years after their MPM had ended. Results: During MPM, HRQoL was significantly improved in 45.6% of the 439 patients, decreased in 30.7% of the patients and did not change in 23.7% of the patients. Patient-related factors that predicted a better HRQoL among the 100 patients with good MPM outcome compared with the 100 patients with poor MPM outcome were higher education and better employment status. Age, gender, marital status, duration of pain, number of pain sites, pain intensity or pain interference at baseline did not differ between the patient groups. Patient expectations regarding MPM were similar. A tendency towards more psychiatric comorbidity in the non-responder group was seen. The duration of MPM in the two patient groups was similar, as well as the number of medications started, the variety of specialists seen and psychiatric counselling with supportive therapy included. More non-responder than responder patients had died during the three-year follow-up period, some of the deaths were related to substance abuse. Conclusions and Implications: HRQoL in chronic pain patients was significantly improved during MPM compared with the baseline. Pain duration of several years, multiple pain sites and neuropathic pain were not discerning factors between the responders and non-responders of the present study, implying that a positive change in HRQoL may be achieved by MPM even in these pain patients. In agreement with previous studies, factors predicting poor treatment outcome in the non-responder group of chronic pain patients were not treatment related. To further improve MPM outcome even in pain patients with risk factors for less benefit of treatment such as low education and poor general health, more individualized MPM approaches with emphasis on analysis and treatment of psychological symptoms and patient beliefs is essential.

AB  - A multimodal treatment program is presented in cases of functional restoration for chronic low back pain. The study comprises four parts. Part I gives an overview of the different results of the study. Part II focuses on the medical and functional examination in comparison with persons who do not suffer from back pain. Part III describes psychosocial aspects (depression, complaints, ways of coping, disability) and psychotherapy. In part IV prognostic factors and their reliability for predicting treatment outcome (return to work, pain intensity, self-assessment of success by patients) are examined. In addition the relevant effects of the program on social and health care systems are also addressed. PROBLEM: The incidence of low back pain is continuously increasing, causing tremendous costs for the health insurance system. Therefore effective treatment methods are needed that take into account somatic, psychological and social factors. Chronic low back pain is conceptualized as a complex phenomenon including biological, social and psychological aspects, all of which should be addressed in a treatment program. A multimodal treatment program for chronic low back pain is presented, in which physical activity and cooperation of the patient are the primary targets. Therapeutic aims focus less on pain reduction and emphasize instead pain control, individual responsibility of the patient, and early reintegration into the working environment. The specific goals of the program are to increase the physical abilities of the patients (i. e., flexibility, strength and endurance), to increase patients' knowledge and the use of body mechanics and back protection techniques, to decrease medication-intake, to decrease dependency on the medical community, to improve patients' own positive coping skills and levels of emotional control, to increase the patient's activity level at home and to facilitate a return to work. METHODS: A total of 90 disabled patients with chronic low back pain were admitted to an 8-week program of functional restoration and behavioral support. The program consisted of a pre-program (3 weeks: education, stretching and calisthenic exercises) and an intensive treatment period (aerobics, functional strength and endurance exercises, back exercises, cognitive behavioral group therapy, relaxation training, socioeconomic and vocational counseling) which took place for 5 weeks, 7 h a day, on an outpatient basis. Apart from a medical examination and a personal interview, the patients' physical impairment, pain descriptions, and psychological distress (according to different criteria for evaluation) were also measured. This includes variables such as depression, psychovegetative complaints, quality of life and workplace satisfaction, disability, and coping with disease. Measurements were repeated at the end of the 8-week program, and after 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: In total 84 patients (94 %) were examined following treatment. There was a statistically significant improvement in flexibility, strength, lifting capacity, and endurance measurements ( p < 0.001) at the end of the treatment. In addition, significant reductions in pain, disability, depression, and psychovegetative signs were demonstrated ( p < 0.001). There was a decreased use of medical treatment for back pain following the program, with 42 % of the patients refraining from the intake of analgesics, followed by a significant reduction in physiotherapy and the consultation of physicians. Assessment of the patients' reported increased activity levels at home also supported findings that statistical improvements were significant. Sixty-three percent of the patients were found to have returned to active, productive work following discharge from the program. Most of the improvements remained stable at the 6- and 12-month follow-up examinations. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the multimodal program of functional restoration, not only concerning positive changes in somatic, psychological and physical variables, but also with respect to the umber f patients who returned to work. Our methods are also compared with the discrepant results of multimodal treatment in the United States and Scandinavia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study takes a new approach to understanding how presenteeism relates to chronic pain or disability patient outcomes. METHODS: The sample consisted of 2191 consecutive chronic disabling musculoskeletal disorder patients, classified as either presentees (N = 704), or absentees (N = 1487), who were admitted to a functional restoration program. The measures included medical evaluations, demographic data, psychiatric diagnoses at admission, an 1 year follow-up socioeconomic outcome assessment and validated questionnaires evaluating pain, depression, and function. RESULTS: The findings revealed that patients classified as presentees were significantly more likely to complete the prescribed functional restoration treatment program, to return to work (full-duty or full-time), to retain work 1-year posttreatment, and not to have a decrease in job demand from preinjury to posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both employees and employers will benefit if the ill or injured employee stays at work postinjury in lieu of short- or long-term disability. ©2009 The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.

AB  - Patients treated in interdisciplinary chronic pain rehabilitation programs show long-term improvements in symptoms; however, outcomes may vary across heterogenous patient subpopulations. This longitudinal retrospective study characterizes the influence of opioids, mood, patient characteristics, and baseline symptoms on pain and functional impairment (FI) in 1,681 patients 6-months to 12-months post-treatment in an interdisciplinary chronic pain rehabilitation program incorporating opioid weaning. Linear mixed models showed immediate and durable treatment benefits with nonuniform worsening at follow up which slowed over time. Latent class growth analysis identified three post-treatment trajectories of pain and FI: mild symptoms and durable benefits, moderate symptoms and durable benefits, and intractable symptoms. A fourth pain trajectory showed immediate post-treatment improvement and worsening at follow up. Whether a patient was weaned from opioids was not predictive of treatment trajectory. Racial ethnic minority status, higher levels of post-treatment depression, and lower perceived treatment response were associated with less resolution (moderate symptoms) or intractable symptoms. Not having a college education was predictive of intractable or worsening pain and a moderate course of FI. Older age and male gender was associated with intractable FI. Treatment outcomes may be improved by the development of targeted interventions for patients at risk of poor recovery and/or deteriorating long-term course. Perspective(s): This study examined predictors of treatment response in 1,681 patients treated in an interdisciplinary chronic pain rehabilitation program incorporating opioid weaning. Opioid weaning did not predict outcome. Higher levels of symptoms, lower levels of education, and being a racial-ethnic minority were associated with a less salubrious long-term treatment response.Copyright © 2019 the American Pain Society

AB  - Increased prescribing of opioids for chronic noncancer pain is associated with significant social costs, including overdose and addiction. In this context, there is interest in interdisciplinary chronic pain rehabilitation programs focusing on self-management and minimizing opioid use. This study examined outcomes of patients weaned from opioids in an ICPRP from 2007 to 2012. Participants included 413 patients on high dose chronic opioid therapy (COT; >100 mg), 528 on low dose COT, and 516 not on opioids (NO). Outcomes were assessed at discharge, 6, and 12 months posttreatment through self-report and chart review. One thousand one hundred ninety-four participants completed treatment (81.95%); 86.74% of those on opioids were weaned. High doses were less likely to complete (78.45%) than NO participants (85.27%; P < 0.05). Results showed immediate (P < 0.01) and sustained improvements (P < 0.05) in pain severity, depression, anxiety, and functional impairment with no group differences. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large (Cohen d values 0.57-1.96). Longitudinal medication use data were available for 319 no dose and 417 weaned participants; opioid resumption rates were 10.51% and 30.70% respectively. There were no differences in resumption between the high dose and low dose groups. Logistic regression analyses determined that opioid dose predicted neither treatment completion nor opioid resumption. Anxiety predicted completion, and functional impairment predicted opioid resumption within 1 year of discharge. Results suggest that patients on COT can be successfully weaned with long-term benefits in pain, mood, and function. Targeting anxiety and functional restoration may increase success rates.

AB  - Objective. Functional restoration programs for chronic low back pain (CLBP) have been shown to be successful in improving function and, to a lesser extent, in reducing pain. The Munich Functional Restoration Program (MFRP) is a 4-week outpatient program designed to reduce pain and to improve health-related quality of life in patients with a long history of CLBP. Design. In a retrospective matched concurrent-controls therapeutic study, 44 patients with CLBP, who had either undergone MFRP or received an outpatient standard treatment (control) after initial evaluation at the pain center, completed questionnaires 1 year after the respective therapy (t1). The following parameters were assessed: health-related quality of life with Short Form-36 (SF-36), Pain Disability Index (PDI), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain, depression with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Test (CES-D), and occupational situation. These data were compared with baseline values assessed by a questionnaire completed before starting the respective treatment (baseline, t0). Results. Compared with control, NRS and PDI were significantly better in patients completing the MFRP. Patients of the MFRP group showed also a significant reduction in CES-D as well as an improvement in three of eight SF-36 subscales. No changes were detected in the control group receiving standard treatment. Conclusions. Compared with standard treatment, a functional restoration program for CLBP significantly improves some aspects of health-related quality of life. It results in a decrease of pain and pain-related disability even in patients with a long history of CLBP. © American Academy of Pain Medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association between opioid use and treatment outcome (symptom severity, quality of life [QOL]) after a brief interdisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment program (FTP). METHOD(S): Subjects (n = 971) with fibromyalgia participated in the FTP. They filled out the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Short Form-36 Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36) at baseline and 6 to 12 months after the FTP. Post-treatment changes in FIQ and SF-36 scores were compared after stratifying the participants into opioid user and non-opioid user groups. RESULT(S): A total of 236 patients (24.3%) were opioid users. Compared with non-opioid users, the opioid users had worse symptom severity measured using FIQ total score (p < .001) and all subscales at baseline and post treatment, as well as worse QOL measured using all SF-36 subscales and physical and mental components. Comparison of least-square means of mean change of QOL between opioid users and non-opioid users after analysis of covariance adjusted patient characteristics and baseline scores showed that the FIQ subscale scores of physical impairment (p < .05), job ability (p < .05), and fatigue (p < .05) were significantly less improved in the opioid users compared with the non-opioid users. Moreover, the SF-36 subscale score of general health perception (p < .05) was significantly less improved in the opioid users compared with non-opioid users. However, post-treatment changes in mean scores for QOL subscale generally did not significantly differ in both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Opioid use did not affect response to the FTP, as measured using the FIQ total score or SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores. Furthermore, the opioid user group showed less improvement in the FIQ subscale scores of physical impairment, job ability, and fatigue and in the SF-36 subscale scores of general health perception.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Biopsychosocial rehabilitation programs have been advocated for its management, especially since the widespread acceptance of the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain. Despite extensive evidence of its short-term benefits, few studies have reported on its long-term effect and more specifically on indirect outcomes such as return to work and quality of life (QoL). The present study evaluated the long-term effect of a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) program for patients with chronic LBP, for which short- and intermediate-term efficacy had been established, with an emphasis on recovering work capability., METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled 201 patients on a four-week MBR program incorporating physical and occupational therapies and psychological counselling. Assessments occurred at program admission and discharge and at 6 and 18 months. Work capability, Oswestry Disability Index, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were assessed. Multiple mixed models were used to detect changes in each outcome. Logistic regressions were calculated to identify predictors of recovery of work capability., RESULTS: Of the 201 patients who fulfilled the eligibility criteria, 160 (79.8%) attended the discharge assessment, 127 (63.2%) attended the 6-month follow-up, and 107 (53.3%) continued to the 18-month follow-up. Initially, 128 patients (71.5%) had been on sick leave. At 6 and 18 months, 72 (56.7%) and 84 (78.5%) participants had recovered their work capability, respectively. There were significant improvements in pain, disability, kinesiophobia, and anxiety and depression scores over time. Patients who recovered work capability showed significantly greater improvements in their total COMI score, general QoL, and disability, which were the best three predictors of recovering work capability., CONCLUSIONS: This study extends previous results confirming the program's contribution to recovering work capability among chronic LBP patients.

AB  - Fibromyalgia often leads to serious restrictions in the quality of life of the patients and causes high socioeconomic costs due to frequent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and, above all, due to sickness leave and a high rate of early retirements. The article presents a comprehensive therapeutic concept developed in the rheumatologic rehabilitation hospital Bad Sackingen on the basis of recommendations in the international scientific literature. The concept aims at improving the functional capacities of the patients in occupation and everyday life, at raising stamina, as well as informing patients about the disease and reducing pain, anxiety and depression. The special setup in the hospital includes stable groups of patients staying together during the entire period of three to four weeks of treatment, regular team conferences, and external supervision by a clinical psychologist. Treatment programs concentrate on patient education, drugs, physiotherapy (including Nordic Walking and exercise) and physical therapy (including whole-body cryotherapy), as well as psychological treatment in groups (autogenic training, muscle relaxation) or on an individual basis, if necessary. A prospective study on 317 patients with fibromyalgia showed that, at admission, nearly all patients were severely strained in terms of somatic symptoms, pain, functional impairments, and emotional problems. After three to four weeks of treatment according to the above concept, overall health and the somatic and psychological status were significantly improved with effect sizes of 0.50 to 0.60. These positive effects declined continually at three, six and twelve months after discharge but were still maintained in a statistically significant way, even if effect sizes went down to about 0.30. Much lower, if any - effects, however, were obtained in the areas of functional impairments in occupational and everyday life. The article suggests continuing training programs on an outpatient basis to further improve functional capacities in these areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with fibromyalgia (FM) have a substantially reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Their management should preferably focus on multidisciplinary nonpharmacological intervention. However, the long-term impact of such multicomponent therapies is not fully established. Waiting lists for patients seeking medical treatment are long, making individual-based approaches often unfeasible. The aim of our pragmatic study was to evaluate long-term HRQoL benefits of a comprehensive 8-week group-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation program focusing on patients' coping ability and self-care. METHOD(S): A total of 94 patients with clinically confirmed FM agreed to participate in this study. Before entering the program based on group-based cognitive behavioral therapy and graded activity training, patients completed questionnaires to screen for comorbidities. Health-related quality of life was assessed at the start, at 8 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year using the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey instrument. Changes in HRQoL scores were analyzed according to linear mixed regression modeling. RESULT(S): Baseline findings confirmed the substantially lower physical and mental HRQoL in FM patients as well as high levels of depression, anxiety, and burnout. Only 2 patients left the program prematurely; 89% participated in the 1-year assessment. By the end of the program, HRQoL was significantly improved in all domains. This effect was maintained at 6 months and 1 year for all subscales. Changes at 1 year were greater in younger patients and those with depressive feelings before the start of treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Our group-based program offered to FM patients proved successful with significant improvements in their HRQoL both in the short and long term.

AB  - A common theme in the pain literature is that worker's compensation reinforces pain behavior and adversely influences treatment outcome of chronic pain patients. This study compared 110 chronic low back pain males divided into three groups: 44 receiving no compensation, 27 receiving time-limited worker's compensation, and 39 receiving unlimited social security disability benefits. All patients participated in a multimodal treatment program (e.g. nerve blocks, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, relaxation training, biofeedback). Physician ratings of pain behavior and self-report measures of pain characteristics, activity level, and medication intake were gathered pretreatment; self-report measures were collected again approximately one year following treatment. The results showed disability patients to have a higher percentage of physician rated symptom dramatization and pain behavior and a greater usage of medication compared with the non-compensation and time-limited worker's compensation patients. At follow-up, no between group differences were found on measures of pain intensity, medication usage and activity. In general, however, more worker's compensation and non-compensation patients who were initially not working had returned to work at the time of follow-up compared with the disability patients. These results suggest that time-limited compensation may not affect treatment outcome or interfere with return-to-work chances while unlimited compensation may adversely influence the probability that patients will return to work. These findings support the notion that worker's compensation patients receiving time-limited financial benefits do not necessarily represent a 'problem' subgroup of chronic pain patients.

AB  - This study was designed to determine a cost-effective use of psychologist resources in multimodal cognitive-behavioural treatments (MMCBT) for chronic neck/shoulder pain. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 66 patients divided in two groups. The first group (A) was treated following the approach of MMCBT with the clinical psychologist only functioning as a 'coach' to the other health professionals. In this group, the psychologist had on average 5 hours of input per patients. The second group (B) was treated with the same inpatient MMCBT but with the behavioural component administered by the clinical psychologist directly to the patients. In this second group the psychologist had on average 17 hours of input per patient in the entire intervention. The outcome variables included physical, emotional and social factors, and sick-leave. Both groups showed significant improvements over time. The improvements were evident only in sub-groups, specifically in women. The only significant difference between the groups was in 'perceived helplessness' favouring the 'psychologist contact' setting. It is concluded that in terms of input of clinical psychology, the treatment setting with the 'coaching' technique proved to be the most cost-effective use of the psychologist in the two treatment settings investigated.

AB  - Compared the outcome of a behavioral medicine (BM) rehabilitation program with its 2 main components, physical therapy (PT) and cognitiveâ€“behavioral therapy (CBT). 214 employees (mean age 43.3 yrs) on sick leave and experiencing long-term, non-specific spinal pain completed interventions using part-time CBT, part-time PT, or full-time BM. Booster sessions were conducted periodically. Ss completed questionnaires pre- and posttreatment, and at 6- and 18-mo follow-ups. Sick leave, early retirement, and health-related quality of life were measured. Results show significantly less chance of being granted full-time early retirement for PT and CBT females compared to untreated controls during the 18-mo follow-up period. However, the total absence from work in days over that period was not significantly different in treatment Ss compared to controls. Female CBT and BM Ss reported a significantly better health-related quality of life than did controls at 18-mo follow-up. No significant differences for males were found. It is concluded that there are gender differences in treatment outcome and that the full-time BM program was no more effective than the part-time PT and CBT programs.

AB  - An outpatient multimodal cognitive-behavioural treatment program (MMCBT) for chronic spinal pain was evaluated during an 18-month follow-up period. The treatment included a 1-day course for the patients' work supervisors. The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term effect of the treatment program as well as the effect of a work supervisor-training program on the patients' return to work. The design was a matched cohort study with four repeated measures. Two groups of subjects suffering from non-specific spinal pain (treatment group n = 67, no treatment control group n = 29) were assessed with regard to pain intensity, sick-leave, pain coping ability and behavioural changes at work and in personal life. Recordings on supervisors attending the course and changes of supervisory behaviour were also obtained. The results show a significant between group difference in pain intensity and perceived pain coping ability at work, favouring the MMCBT group. Further, the MMCBT intervention enhances self-reported behavioural changes in areas within the subjects' own control. There is not sufficient statistical support to accept the assumption of MMCBT being superior in reducing sick-leave, either with or without the education of supervisors. Even when supervisors changed their behaviour as reported by the patient, no significant effect was found on patients' return to work. In conclusion, the MMCBT do not seem to be effective in reducing sick-leave compared to no treatment, but the MMCBT program is superior in decreasing pain intensity, enhancing self-reported behavioural changes in personal life and improving pain coping ability at work.

AB  - This prospective randomized controlled outcome study was designed to evaluate whether a MultiModal Cognitive - Behavioral Treatment for chronic spinal pain (MMCBT) specifically designed for women has an increased effect on well being and return to work compared to a regular MMCBT regimen. In Sweden, spinal pain is most prevalent among women. A tremendous amount of money is spent on secondary prevention of spinal pain. Yet, little is known about the effect of the interventions. A need for well designed outcome studies exist. Fifty-four subjects from a cohort of all registered sick- listed women in three districts of Stockholm participated in the study. Subjects were allocated by central randomization into two groups. One group was treated with a regular MMCBT program and the other group with a MMCBT program specifically designed for women. Assessments were performed at pretreatment-posttreatment (last treatment day) and at 6 and 18 months posttreatment. Questionnaires covering the bio-psycho-social spectra of the chronic pain syndrome, and sick leave were used to measure outcome. Intention to treat and true to protocol analyses were performed. The only significant differences found between groups were improvements in self-reported disability and in coping with pain, favoring the experimental treatment. About one-third of the variance in disability was explained by the set of pain-coping strategies assessed in the study. The results do not lend sufficient statistical support to warrant acceptance of the experimental treatment as superior to the regular treatment in improving health and sick leave. Further investigation with larger groups is needed before a solid- scientific conclusion can be drawn.

AB  - Background: In Denmark, opioids have been used liberally for many years in the treatment of non-malignant pain, but long-term consequences as tolerance and influence on health related quality of life remain unknown. Aim: Adherence to medical treatment, opioid dose escalation, health related quality of life, anxiety, depression, coping strategies, and health care utilization were evaluated in chronic pain patients 10 years after treatment in a multidisciplinary pain centre. Methods: Information was gathered from medical records, postal questionnaires and a central hospital register. Results: Opioid dose escalation occurred in only a few patients. Increase and decrease in opioid dose were almost equally frequent. Sixty percent of those discharged on long acting opioids were still on that treatment at follow-up. Twenty-eight percent of the patients initiated opioid treatment after discharge from the pain centre. Occupational status was identified as a determining factor for future opioid use. Opioid users had a lower health related quality of life, higher occurrence of depression and more frequent use of coping strategies like 'Catastrophizing' and 'Hoping and Praying'. Adjuvant analgesics were highly discontinued. Multidisciplinary pain treatment reduced the number of hospital admissions and in-hospital days. Conclusion: We recommend that future research on opioid treatment does not only focus on biological issues. The effect of opioids needs to be viewed in a much more complex context where consequences like health related quality of life, depression and the role of various coping strategies are included.

AB  - To examine the associations between changes in cognitions and coping and multidisciplinary pain treatment outcomes, the authors had 141 patients with chronic pain complete measures of adjustment, beliefs, catastrophizing, and coping; in addition, their significant others rated patient physical functioning at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Decreases in guarding and resting and in the belief that pain signals damage were associated with decreases in patient disability. Increases in perceived control over pain and decreases in catastrophizing and in the belief that one is disabled were associated with decreases in self-reported patient disability, pain intensity, and depression. The results are consistent with the hypothesis, derived from cognitive-behavioral models of chronic pain, that the outcomes of multidisciplinary pain treatment are associated with changes in patient cognitions and coping responses.

AB  - Little is known about how patient functioning changes after completion of multidisciplinary pain programs, and what factors are associated with such changes when they occur; for example, whether improvement or deterioration in functioning corresponds to changes in patient beliefs and coping during this period. The objective of this study was to examine the extent to which changes in patient pain and functioning were associated with changes in beliefs and coping after multidisciplinary pain treatment. Patients with chronic pain (N=141) completed outcome (pain, functioning) and process (beliefs, catastrophizing, coping) measures at the end of multidisciplinary pain treatment and 12 months posttreatment. On average, patients reported similar levels of pain at both times, but showed a small worsening in disability and depression outcomes between posttreatment and follow-up, which were associated significantly with concurrent changes in the process measures. In particular, increased belief in oneself as disabled by pain, catastrophizing, and increased use of resting, guarding and asking for assistance in response to pain were linked with increased disability and depression. Decreased perceived control over pain was also consistently associated with worsening of these outcomes. The results highlight the potential importance of specific pain-related beliefs and coping responses in long-term patient pain and adjustment. Research is needed to determine whether booster interventions after the end of intensive multidisciplinary treatment that target these beliefs and coping responses improve long-term outcomes.

AB  - Background: Chronic knee pain is a major cause of disability in the elderly. Management guidelines recommend exercise and self-management interventions as effective treatments. The authors previously described a rehabilitation programme integrating exercise and self-management [Enabling Self-management and Coping with Arthritic knee Pain through Exercise (ESCAPE-knee pain)] that produced short-term improvements in pain and physical function, but sustaining these improvements is difficult. Moreover, the programme is untried in clinical environments, where it would ultimately be delivered. Objectives: To establish the feasibility of ESCAPE-knee pain and compare its clinical effectiveness and costs with outpatient physiotherapy. Design: Pragmatic, randomised controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient physiotherapy department and community centre. Participants: Sixty-four people with chronic knee pain. Interventions: Outpatient physiotherapy compared with ESCAPE-knee pain. Outcomes: The primary outcome was physical function assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Secondary outcomes included pain, objective functional performance, anxiety, depression, exercise-related health beliefs and healthcare utilisation. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and 12 months after completing the interventions (primary endpoint). ANCOVA investigated between-group differences. Results: Both groups demonstrated similar improvements in clinical outcomes. Outpatient physiotherapy cost 130 per person and the healthcare utilisation costs of participants over 1 year were 583. The ESCAPE-knee pain programme cost 64 per person and the healthcare utilisation costs of participants over 1 year were 320. Conclusions: ESCAPE-knee pain can be delivered as a community-based integrated rehabilitation programme for people with chronic knee pain. Both ESCAPE-knee pain and outpatient physiotherapy produced sustained physical and psychosocial benefits, but ESCAPE-knee pain cost less and was more cost-effective.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 10 to 20 percent of the population is suffering from chronic pain. Since this represents a major contribution to the costs of the health care system, more efficient measures and interventions to treat these patients are sought. RESULTS: The development of general health and physical activity of patients with chronic pain was assessed in an interdisciplinary outpatient pain management program (IOPP). 36 patients with an average age of 48 years were included in the IOPP. Subjective assessment of well-being was performed at five time points (baseline, post intervention and 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter) by using standardized questionnaires. The study focused on the quality of life survey Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36, which is a validated instrument with established reliability and sensitivity. In addition, the patients participated in physical assessment testing strength, power, endurance, and mobility. Prior to therapy a substantial impairment was found on different levels. Marked improvements in the psychological parameters were obtained by the end of the program. No success was achieved with regard to the physical assessments. CONCLUSION: Although many different studies have evaluated similar programs, only few of them have attained positive results such as improvements of general quality of life or of physical strength. Often no difference from the control group could be detected only some months after the intervention. In the present study no significant persistent improvement of well-being occurred. Possible reasons are either wrong instruments, wrong selection of patients or wrong interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of the multidisciplinary Turning Pain Into Gain program in people experiencing chronic pain of any etiology., METHODS: A mixed-methods observational study of 252 participants was used to explore the impact of Turning Pain Into Gain on medication use; quality of life and functioning, as measured by the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire; and self-reported hospitalizations between 2015 and 2016., RESULTS: Responses from 178 participants showed an increased alignment with Australian pain medication guidelines (e.g., a 7.3% reduction in paracetamol duplication was reported with a concurrent 5.1% rise in the administration of sustained-release paracetamol formulations); improved Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire scores from 23.1 (out of a possible score of 60) preprogram to 35.3 postprogram; and a reduction in self-reported hospitalizations from 50 cases in the 12 months preprogram to 11 cases in the 12 months postprogram., CONCLUSIONS: Positive medication, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and hospitalization changes provide evidence for the broader implementation of similar patient-centered programs to promote more holistic management of diverse types of chronic pain in primary care. Reduced hospitalization reflects potential for this intervention to be cost-effective, which could be investigated further. Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Pain Medicine.

AB  - Methods: Long-term outcome in terms of well-being, depression and ability to cope was evaluated by means of a mailed questionnaire up to 5 years after participation in an integrated group treatment program for chronic musculoskeletal pain (mostly back pain). Sixty-one completed questionnaires were available for analysis, representing 69% of all 89 participants. Results: Comparison of responders and nonresponders yielded no important differences. On the basis of their further need for treatment, their working ability and global rating of outcome, patients were divided into three groups: In 18 cases the situation had further improved, 33 were unchanged and 10 had worsened. Sociodemographic data and pain history did not differ among the three groups. Patients with a favorable outcome scored significantly lower than the rest of the patients on a symptom check list and showed the greatest decrease from pretreatment values (if available). They rated themselves significantly higher on the two-dimensional health locus of control scale and were aware of significantly more factors influencing their pain than were the unimproved (unchanged or worsened) patients. Cognitive-behavioral strategies had been continued long-term by 83.6% of the patients and were rated most helpful. Physical training and at least one relaxation technique were continued in 80.3% of the patients, with a slightly lower rating of helpfulness. Improved patients gave generally higher ratings for helpfulness and applied these strategies also to problems other than pain (e.g. anxiety). Conclusions: The majority of patients maintained at least two of the self-help strategies over many years and seem to profit from their use. Positive long-term effects on well-being were visible in 30% of all participants, and these were clearly more orientated towards self-control than the unimproved subgroups.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to investigate whether there were differences in pain and psychological health status in chronic pain patients with and without migration background before and after an 8-week interdisciplinary outpatient pain programme (IOPP). One hundred eighteen consecutively assessed patients were included. Pain and psychological health were recorded prior to and after the intervention, and at the 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up. The migrant group experienced a statistically significant and clinically relevant higher amount of pain and worse psychological functioning than the non-migrant group at all time points. Statistically significant differences between the groups for the variables depression, anxiety, kinesiophobia and passive coping, in particular catastrophizing, were observed in the short and long term. The non-migrant group improved continuously on all outcome measurements at all time points. The results show differences in outcome for chronic pain patients with and without migration background. High pain intensity, high levels of depression, anxiety and catastrophizing at baseline appear to be major barriers for improvement in a sample of migrant patients when participating in an IOPP. Treatments may have to be tailored to the specific needs of this patient group to better address their poor psychological health status and to improve the course of the pain disorder. © 2012 Clinical Rheumatology.

AB  - 23 outpatients with chronic pain (mean age 48.3 yrs) began a 3-part treatment package designed to provide symptom control, stimulus control, and social system modification. 14 Ss completed the full course of therapy. The remaining 9 were designated as partial completers. A mean of 22.9 weekly hour-long therapy sessions resulted in significant decreases in pain, depression, anxiety, and medication intake, as assessed by the Symptom Check List-90, Beck Depression Inventory, Visual Analogue Scale, and weekly self-ratings of pain, depression, anxiety, and work and family satisfaction. These improvements were maintained at 1-yr follow-up. Findings are consistent with the notion that chronic pain is maintained by a combination of inter- and intrapersonal factors. A controlled comparison of this treatment program with other treatments for chronic pain is indicated. (26 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A high performance, active duty fitness requirement group rehabilitated equally to a low performance needs civilian group, both suffering from disabling chronic pain. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine whether higher physical performance requirements adversely affected outcome in a chronic pain rehabilitation program. Twenty-three active duty, chronic pain patients were treated along with 22 civilian chronic pain sufferers in a behavior modification, including positive, verbal reinforcement for performance, stress management and family counseling, physical reconditioning, including stretching, strengthening and aerobic conditioning in a slowly progressive fashion to required needs, and narcotic and muscle relaxant detoxification program at a major military medical center. Eighteen patients in each group, representing, respectively, 78 and 82% of the military and civilian participants, successfully completed the inpatient program. Success was defined by (1) elimination of all narcotics and minor tranquilizers, (2) elimination of all physical restrictions that precluded any desired work or play, which required much higher levels for the active duty patients that included: (3) elimination of all physical profile restrictions and (4) objectively passing annual aerobics field test requirements before the program's end. Review of military disability separation records, averaging 24 mo posttreatment, showed that no formerly successful active duty patients had later been discharged because of physical impairments. Of individuals responding to mail questionnaires at an average of 19 mo postprogram, 12 of 14 (86%) initially successful military patients reported continued unrestricted maintenance of physical abilities, whereas 10 of 14 (71%) of the initially successful civilians reported no restrictions in desired activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Background: Patients' readiness to behavioural changes according to the transtheoretical model (TTM) and criteria of treatment outcome are positively associated and have in part already been confirmed. For a stable effect of therapeutic treatment, patients' readiness to change seems indispensable for an independent and active pain management. Thus, in addition to an enhanced quality of life, increasing patients' motivation is a declared objective of the treatment at Dresden's Comprehensive Pain Center. In this study, it was examined how the readiness to change develops in the course of and during the 2 years following the multimodal treatment program. Furthermore, associations between outcome criteria of the treatment and patients' readiness to change were explored. Materials and methods: The database constitutes 169 patients who took part in a 4-week interdisciplinary, partially residential pain treatment. Beside the Freiburg Pain Stages questionnaire ("Frieburger Fragebogen - Stadien der Bewaltigung chronischer Schmerzen", FF-STABS), a comprehensive pain diagnostic inventory including the Pain Disability Index (PDI), the SF-36 questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was completed at six different time points (beginning of treatment, end of treatment, booster session after 10 weeks, after 6, 12, and 24 months). The statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 16.0 including nonparametric analyses and variance analyses. Results: Significant differences in the level of readiness to change between the beginning of treatment and all follow-up measures were observed. The average patients' readiness to change was still higher after 2 years than at the first measurement. However, a differentiated consideration revealed a small portion of patients who showed no change or even a reduction of motivation. After an additional week (booster session), the stages of readiness to change remained stable, irrespective of the direction of the previous change. Regarding therapeutic outcome, significant short- and long-term improvements were evident. For single outcome parameters, positive associations with the stages of readiness to change were found. Conclusion: The results indicate that the outpatient pain management program favorably affects patients' motivation and general quality of life. This effect also seems to be stable over a long period of time. As not all patients show an improvement in stage of readiness to change, the question arises whether the reason of the differences might lie within the patients' and whether specific interventions for motivation might be useful to enhance motivation before starting treatment. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the relationship between patient demographic variables prior to treatment in a two week cognitive-behavioral outpatient chronic low back pain program and rehabilitation outcome. Objectively defined outcome criteria were utilized to facilitate comparison of results across studies. Patient demographic variables that have shown an inconsistent relationship with outcome in previous research studies were examined for replication and clarification of this relationship. Outcome in long-term follow-up was investigated for possible deterioration of treatment effect over time. Finally, multi-variate analysis was utilized to determine if patient variables form a composite profile that predicts outcome. Subjects chosen for this study were chronic low back pain patients who had attended a two week outpatient multi-disciplinary treatment center that is cognitive-behavioral in orientation. One-hundred-six patients who completed the treatment program between February, 1988 and December, 1992 agreed to participate in this study. The relationship between preprogram patient demographic variables and rehabilitation outcome was compared utilizing Chi Square analyses for categorical variables and one way ANOVA procedures for continuous variables. A logistic regression model was utilized to determine whether patient variables form a composite profile that predicts outcome. The results of this study suggest that participant's age, gender, compensation status and time out of work were not significantly associated with outcome. A relationship was demonstrated between participants with two or more back surgeries and unsuccessful outcome. A preprogram participant profile predicting successful outcome included: (a) involvement in civil litigation; (b) not using narcotic medication; (c) using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication; and (d) not having education after high-school. Treatment effect did not appear to deteriorate over time. This study shoul (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: In contrast to the large evidence of the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) in chronic low back pain, little is known about the effects of MBR in chronic neck pain (CNP)., AIM: To quantify short-term and 12-month effects of a 3-week CNP-specific MBR program., DESIGN: Naturalistic prospective observational cohort study with intraindividual control of effects., SETTING: Outpatient clinic at a tertiary physical medicine and rehabilitation center., POPULATION: Consecutive patients with CNP (N.=81) who participated in a CNP-specific MBR., METHODS: The intervention was a MBR outpatient clinic program. Primary Outcome was the North American Spine Society (NASS) questionnaire pain/function scale. Secondary outcomes included the NASS scale neurogenic symptoms, Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and numerical rating scales (NRS) for maximum and average pain. Short-term changes of health were quantified using effect sizes (ES), which were corrected by the change during waiting time before MBR., RESULTS: At the end of treatment, the NASS pain/function scale showed significant improvement (P<0.001) by a moderate corrected ES (ES=0.59). Moderate significant improvements were also found for the NASS scale neurogenic symptoms (ES=0.65), the SF-36 scales bodily pain (ES=0.56) and mental health (ES=0.54), and the NRS maximum pain (ES=0.59). Significant small corrected ES were found for the SF-36 scales physical functioning (ES=0.32), physical role (ES=0.41), vitality (ES=0.42), social functioning (ES=0.41), emotional role (ES=0.41) and the NRS average pain (ES=0.48). The improvement on the SF-36 scale general health was not significant (ES=0.19). At the follow-up after 12 months, the NASS pain/function scale remained its moderate ES (ES=0.52, P value <0.001). Also, the NASS Scale neurogenic symptoms, the SF-36 scales bodily pain, general health, social functioning and mental health and both NRS pain scales showed significant benefits., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that MBR may be effective in patients with CNP. Maintenance of moderate benefits in pain and function seems possible for at least 12 months., CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: The findings support the concept of CNP-specific MBR.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to investigate gender differences in rehabilitation outcomes and how psychosocial factors may interact to influence rehabilitation outcome in work-disabled with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Methods: One hundred and sixty eight (n=168) persons (mean age = 45.5/SD=9.0) participating in a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program, were included. Data on pain, functional health and psychosocial factors were collected previous to treatment, after 5 week intensive training and after 52 week follow-up period. Demographics, socio-economics and data on personal characteristics were also collected. Results: Significant (p<.05) gender differences were found on sleeplessness, meaningfulness and manageability. No significant gender differences were found on pain or functional health status variables. Gender differences (p<.001) were found in how socio-demographic and psychosocial factors influence rehabilitation outcomes in terms of functional health status. Conclusions: These data suggests that knowledge of gender differences and the way psychosocial factors influence rehabilitation outcomes must be taken into account in designing rehabilitation intervention. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The short- and long-term effects of a 12-week intensive functional restoration programme for 153 participants with chronic spinal pain are reported. The average patient sick leave before the programme started was about one year. At the 2-year follow-up, 69% of the participants reported in telephone interviews that they were working either part time or full time. Aerobic fitness, trunk muscle strength and lifting capacity increased during the programme. In the nonworking groups, pain was rated higher and quality of life lower than in the working groups at the 1- and 2-year follow-ups. For the women's return to job, the best predictors were the time since the original pain onset and the achieved capacity to lift from waist to shoulder level. For the men's return to job, the best predictors were the initial work situation, the time since the original pain onset, the oxygen uptake and the lumbar lifting capacity at the end of the programme. The results of this non-controlled rehabilitation programme, both short- and long-term, support earlier findings that intensive rehabilitation can increase physical capacity and general well-being.

AB  - Objectives: To analyse the frequencies of, and the clinical risk factors for, full-time sick leave (100% sick leave) in the past month after cognitive-behavioural treatment of young persons at risk of permanent disability. Patients and methods: Persons aged 16-45 years on more than six weeks of sick leave for benign disorders were asked to participate in a four-week treatment programme in primary care. It included weekly patient-doctor dialogues on worries about pain, and daily training. Mental and somatic health and psychosocial stressors were assessed. Locations of muscular insertion lesions (enthesopathies) were counted. Pain behaviour was defined as >=1.5 points on the University of Alabama scale. Self-reported inability to work, pain anxiety, pain behaviour and depression were evaluated before and after the treatment. All variables were categorised. Non-parametric tests were used to detect group differences and changes in related dichotomous variables. The variables that were significantly related to 100% sick leave at the three-month, one-year and three-year follow-ups were used as independent variables in multinomial logistic regression calculations of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for 100% sick leave in the past month. Also, three or more enthesopathy locations and previous 100% sick leave of more than three months were chosen as independent variables. The ORs were adjusted for age and sex. Results: Two Swedes and 149 immigrants participated; nearly all were working in the service sector. Long periods of sick leave were common, on average 47 weeks. All reported pain as their major problem, mostly in the back and shoulders, and 27.8% had three or more locations of enthesopathies. Pain anxiety (76% to 50%), self-reported inability to work (75% to 60%) and pain behaviour (68% to 54%) were common but diminished after treatment (p<0.001). The frequency of 100% sick leave in the past month decreased at the follow-ups, from 76% at the start to 48%, 44% and 51%, respectively (p<0.001). Persons with self-reported inability to work had ORs of 3.04 (95% CI 1.22-7.56) at the three-month follow-up, and 3.13 after one year (95% CI 1.26-7.80) for being on 100% sick leave, while persons with three or more enthesopathy locations had an OR of 2.98 (95% CI 1.19-7.44) after three years. Previous durations of 100% sick leave of more than three months had significant ORs varying from 5.19 to 2.89. Conclusion: The number of persons on 100% sick leave declined significantly after this treatment. The risk factors for future 100% sick leave were, in the short term, self-reported inability to work and, in the long term, multiple enthesopathies.

AB  - The long-term psychosocial and physical functioning impact of an outpatient interdisciplinary pain management program was evaluated by comparison of pain management completors and a no-treatment group. Although pain intensity did not change and there were no significant differences between groups in several aspects of daily activity, the group that completed the program reported a greater sense of control over pain, had a more hopeful outlook on the future, perceived pain as interfering less with their life, and used strategies that are considered adaptive for long-term management of pain. The results suggest that patients with chronic, complex pain problems can improve perceptions regarding pain control and reduce the interference of pain in their lives. Outlook regarding the future was identified as a critical assessment and treatment variable. Individuals who were more optimistic about the future perceived a greater control over pain and endorsed coping stategies that involve diverting attention, ignoring pain sensations, and making coping self-statements. Although pain intensity rating did not differ, individuals who had a more pessimistic outlook on life considered pain to interfere with their work activity, mood, relations with other people, and overall enjoyment of life to a greater extent than individuals who were more optimistic.

AB  - Introduction: functional restoration of the spine is a proven method in the short-term management of chronic low back pain. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of a functional restoration program at two years of evolution. Method(s): retrospective study of patients enrolled in a functional restoration program during 2014 and summoned after two years, in 2016. Patients have had the same clinical and functional evaluation before the program, at five weeks and at two years. Result(s): Thirty patients were enrolled in the study. The average age was 45 years. Eighty % of the patients were overweight. Significant improvement for all clinical and functional parameters at five weeks was noted. This gain was maintained significantly for some parameters at two years. Conclusion(s): The results of the functional rehabilitation of the spine are satisfactory at two years of evolution.

AB  - Objective: Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and costly condition with few proven treatment options. Since 2014, Geisinger's Department of Pain Medicine has implemented the Multidisciplinary Pain Program (MPP), which consists of a 3-day educational seminar followed by 12 months of comprehensive care. This study examines the impact of MPP on care utilization and cost between 2014 and 2016. Method(s): A retrospective health insurance claims data analysis covering a 3-year period between January 2013 and December 2016. Among all patients referred to MPP during the period, a subset of those who were Geisinger Health Plan (GHP) members was identified (113 patients). Those who were GHP members and were referred to MPP after December 2016 served as the contemporaneous comparison group (69 patients). GHP's claims data for the corresponding period were analyzed on a per-member-per-month (PMPM) basis. Result(s): MPP was associated with US$754 PMPM reduction in total cost of care including prescription drug costs (P=0.014) and US$846 reduction in total medical cost excluding prescription drugs (P=0.006). These cost savings were attributable to reductions in utilization of high-end diagnostic imaging (52 per-1,000 members-per month; P=0.015) and acute inpatient admissions (20 per-1,000 members-per month; P=0.086). Conclusion(s): Patients enrolled in MPP were less likely to use expensive diagnostic imaging and experienced fewer hospitalizations, resulting in total cost of care savings. These findings are consistent with the expectation that MPP improves health outcomes among patients suffering from chronic pain. Copyright © 2018 Maeng et al.

AB  - To determine maintenance of lifestyle changes following completion of an inpatient behavioral pain management program, 40 patients were followed up by questionnaire 6 months to 3 years after program completion, with the majority contacted at least 18 months postdischarge. Thirty-two patients completed some portion of the questionnaire. Responders were similar to nonresponders in age, sex, chronicity of pain on admission, and time since discharge. Responses to specific items indicated that patients had increased activity level and employment and had decreased use of pain-related medications. A global measure of success was based on 3 criteria: (1) reported nonuse of narcotic analgesics, muscle relaxants and tranquilizers; (2) status as employed, in training, or running a household or continuation of 50% to 100% of exercises and reported increased recreational activities; and (3) no reported increase in pain. Of the patients providing adequate data for application of these criteria, 37% met all 3 standards at follow-up. Such a multivariate criterion is recommended for assessment of multidisciplinary pain programs. More frequently practiced behaviors (ie, nonuse of medications, exercises) appeared better maintained. Thus, increased behavioral practice, particularly in vocational and recreational activities, is recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this randomized controlled study was to investigate whether additional psychologic interventions in the context of multidisciplinary inpatient pain treatment increases treatment efficacy compared with normal orthopedic rehabilitation. In addition, we aimed to demonstrate the additional benefit of a subsequent maintenance program in further stabilizing treatment successes. METHODS: We randomly assigned 363 chronic back pain patients to 1 of 3 treatment conditions: traditional orthopedic rehabilitation, multidisciplinary (behavioral-medical) rehabilitation alone, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation with subsequent booster sessions. Pain disability, depression, self-efficacy, health status, life satisfaction, and coping strategies were assessed at admission, discharge, and 12 months follow-up. The completion rate was 94%. RESULTS: All 3 treatment conditions were effective in improving core outcome measures in chronic back pain patients in the short term. The results were almost maintained at follow-up (small-to-medium within-group effect sizes). Significant advantages in favor of behavioral-medical interventions were found on almost all pain coping strategies and depression compared with traditional orthopedic rehabilitation. We found only slight advantages for the behavioral-medical treatment with subsequent booster sessions compared with the condition without a further maintenance program. DISCUSSION: The results concerning the efficacy of the multidisciplinary treatment are in accordance with former meta-analyses. Surprisingly, the findings suggest that the presented traditional orthopedic treatment was inherently very effective. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the benefit of additional psychologic interventions and the benefit of aftercare approaches for chronic pain patients.

AB  - Abstract Background: Neck and back pain are among the most common causes of prolonged disability, and development of interventions with effect on pain, disability and return to work is important. Reduction of fear avoidance might be one mechanism behind improvement after interventions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in pain and disability at the 12-month follow-up of patients with neck and back pain treated with a work-focused intervention compared to patients treated with standard interventions, and the influence of improvement fear avoidance beliefs during the interventions on pain, disability and return to work at 12-month follow-up. Methods: 413 employed patients with back or neck pain referred to secondary care, and sick-listed between 4 weeks and 12 months, were randomized to a work-focused rehabilitation or control interventions. Follow-up was conducted 4 and 12 months after inclusion. The groups were compared (independent sample t-test) regarding differences in disability scores (Oswestry disability index/neck disability index) and pain (numeric rating scale) from baseline to 12-month follow-up. Changes in fear avoidance beliefs (FABQ) from baseline to 4 month follow-up were calculated, and the association between this change and return to work, pain and disability at 12 months were tested in stepwise multiple logistic regression models. Results: Pain and, disability scores decreased to in both the work-focused and control intervention to 12-month follow-up, and there were no significant differences between the groups. FABQ decreased similarly in both groups to 4 month follow-up. The logistic regression model revealed an association between a reduced FABQ work score at 4 months and return to work within one year (adjusted OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.19 to 10.88). Reduced FABQ physical activity score at 4 months was associated with decreased disability after 12 months (adjusted OR (3.65. 95% CI 1.43 to 9.28). Conclusions: Short work-focused rehabilitation had the same effect on pain and disability as control interventions. Reduction in FABQ-W score after treatment seems to be an important predictor for return to work in both groups. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00840697 Copyright © 2015 Marchand et al.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain leads to high costs in the form of compensation for absence from work due to illness, production loss and health care utilization. Multidisciplinary treatment programmes at pain clinics can result in return to work and a decrease in doctor visits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term influences of a rehabilitation programme in primary health care for chronic pain patients with regard to doctor visits, frequency of sick-leave and level of disability. DESIGN: A longitudinal, intervention study design was used over a three-year period. METHODS: A biopsychosocial rehabilitation programme based on ego-strengthening psychotherapy was used. An occupational therapist and a physiotherapist led the intervention, which comprised two meetings per week for six weeks. The study was performed in a primary health care area in the southwest of Sweden with 54 chronic pain patients. RESULTS: The results showed a significant decrease in the number of doctor visits as well as sick-leave days. The level of absenteeism due to occupational disability changed significantly from being on sick leave to receiving a disability pension. CONCLUSIONS: The rehabilitation programme reduced patient attendance at health care facilities but did not increase the numbers of patients returning to work.

AB  - Objective: Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder with a range of comorbid symptoms, including anxiety. We aimed to prospectively identify predictors of the long-term impact of fibromyalgia on health-related quality of life after the end of an interdisciplinary intervention. Methods: 138 patients with fibromyalgia, selected from a hospital pain management unit, participated in a 6-week interdisciplinary treatment that combined coordinated psychological, medical, educational, and physiotherapeutic interventions. Participants completed the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline and 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the intervention. Multivariable generalized linear mixed models were developed, using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire score as a continuous variable. Results: Variables that were significant predictors of the long-term impact of fibromyalgia on health-related quality of life in patients who completed a 6-week interdisciplinary treatment were marital status, the number of concurrent conditions, years since the onset of pain, and symptoms of anxiety. In the longitudinal analysis, patients with symptoms of anxiety had lower rates of improvement than those without symptoms of anxiety. Discussion: Our results suggest that patients with lower level of anxiety have less impact on their HRQoL. The results also provide evidence that starting interventions as soon as possible is an important factor for improving health-related quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disorder that can have a devastating effect on patients' lives. This study assessed the efficacy of a 6-week interdisciplinary treatment that combines coordinated PSYchological, Medical, Educational, and PHYsiotherapeutic interventions (PSYMEPHY) compared with standard pharmacologic care. DESIGN: The study was a randomized controlled trial (54 participants in the PSYMEPHY group and 56 in the control group [CG] ) with follow-up at 6 months. PSYMEPHY patients were also assessed at 12 months. The main outcomes were changes in total Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) score, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, anxiety, and use of pain coping strategies as measured by the FIQ, the visual analog scale, and the Coping with Chronic Pain Questionnaire. After the 6-month assessment, patients in the CG were offered the PSYMEPHY treatment, and completed all of the instruments immediately after treatment, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up visits (N = 93). SETTING: Subjects received therapy at two different outpatient clinical locations. PATIENTS: Fibromyalgia patients. RESULTS: Six months after the intervention, significant improvements in total FIQ score (P = 0.04), and pain (P = 0.03) were seen in the PSYMEPHY group compared with controls. Twelve months after the intervention, all patients in the PSYMEPHY group maintained statistically significant improvements in total FIQ score, and pain, and showed an improvement in fatigue, rested, anxiety, and current pain compared with baseline. Data from the control patients who underwent the PSYMEPHY intervention corroborated the initial results. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the beneficial effects of an interdisciplinary treatment for FM patients in a hospital pain management unit. A 6-week interdisciplinary intervention showed significant improvement in key domains of fibromyalgia, as quality of life, pain, fatigue, rested, and anxiety at 12 months.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of a 6-week interdisciplinary treatment that combines coordinated psychological, medical, educational, and physiotherapeutic components (PSYMEPHY) over time compared to standard pharmacologic care. METHODS: Randomised controlled trial with follow-up at 6 months for the PSYMEPHY and control groups and 12 months for the PSYMEPHY group. Participants were 153 outpatients with FM recruited from a hospital pain management unit. Patients randomly allocated to the control group (CG) received standard pharmacologic therapy. The experimental group (EG) received an interdisciplinary treatment (12 sessions). The main outcome was changes in quality of life, and secondary outcomes were pain, physical function, anxiety, depression, use of pain coping strategies, and satisfaction with treatment as measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Coping with Chronic Pain Questionnaire, and a question regarding satisfaction with the treatment. RESULTS: Six months after the intervention, significant improvements in quality of life (p=0.04), physical function (p=0.01), and pain (p=0.03) were seen in the PSYMEPHY group (n=54) compared with controls (n=56). Patients receiving the intervention reported greater satisfaction with treatment. Twelve months after the intervention, patients in the PSYMEPHY group (n=58) maintained statistically significant improvements in quality of life, physical functioning, pain, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, and were less likely to use maladaptive passive coping strategies compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: An interdisciplinary treatment for FM was associated with improvements in quality of life, pain, physical function, anxiety and depression, and pain coping strategies up to 12 months after the intervention.

AB  - Between September 1979 and October 1982, 408 patients with chronic benign pain were evaluated for admission to a pain management program. Of the 408 patients, 249 completed the program; the success rate at the time of dismissal was 70% among these 249 patients. Of the 239 patients who entered the follow-up study, 87% responded to either a mailed questionnaire or a follow-up telephone call by an independent reviewer at the time of 3 year follow-up; the improvement had been maintained by 46.6% of the successfully treated patients (or a third of the original participants). The present finding is strikingly similar to that in a previous study from this institution - an indication of the long-term efficacy of the multidisciplinary pain management program. Further search for modifications for the existing program is indicated to accommodate the needs of patients who fail initially or cannot maintain the improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventional pain physicians commonly encounter patients with a treatment refractory "chronic pain syndrome". Such patients have a chronically painful medical disorder that is complicated by a number of psychosocial factors, including psychiatric and substance use disorders, physical deconditioning, dependency upon the healthcare system, and perceived impairments that are out of proportion to objective medical findings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the following study was to determine the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary chronic pain program for adult patients with treatment refractory chronic pain syndromes. METHODS: The following sequential, prospective, observational case series presents treatment outcome data on a 4-week multidisciplinary chronic pain program for adult patients with complex chronic pain syndromes that were refractory to standard pain management. Prior to enrollment in the program, patients had been treated with pain medications, physical therapy, and interventional procedures. Data were collected and analyzed on variables including pain ratings, healthcare utilization, opioid medication use, and perceived physical functioning at program admission and discharge as well as at intervals of 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-discharge. RESULTS: Analysis of the data reveal statistically significant improvements in the variables of interest across most time parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that participation in a chronic pain program is an effective intervention for selected patients with refractory pain.

AB  - Background context: Clinicians have long hypothesized that gender may be a risk factor in treatment outcomes of patients with chronic disability associated with musculoskeletal disorders. Although the scientific literature shows a higher prevalence of occupational low back injury in men, and a higher rate of repetitive motion and neck injuries in women, few studies have comprehensively investigated the role of gender regarding cost-related outcome variables of significance after work-related injuries. Purpose: This study was designed to examine the relationship between gender and biopsychosocial treatment outcomes in a predominately chronically disabled spinal disorder (CDSD) workers' compensation cohort undergoing a tertiary functional restoration program. Study design: A prospective comparison cohort study investigating the effect of gender on biopsychosocial treatment outcomes as risk factors for rehabilitation failure. Patient sample: A cohort of 1,827 consecutively treated patients with CDSD were placed into two gender-based groups: men (n=1,158, average age 40.7+/-10 years) and women (n=669, average age 42.5+/-10 years). Outcome measures: Before the start of the program, and again upon completion of the program, all patients received a standard psychosocial assessment and were assessed on a variety of physical factors (leading to a cumulative score, calculated on the basis of the aggregates and averages of these physical measures). A structured clinical interview examining socioeconomic outcomes was conducted at 1 year after program completion, and at least partial information was obtained from this interview on all patients in the present study. Methods: All patients underwent a medically directed functional restoration program combining quantitatively guided exercise progression with a multimodal disability management approach using psychological and case management techniques. Results: Men had a significantly higher rate of lumbar injury than women, whereas women had a significantly higher rate of cervical injury. Men returned to work and retained work at a 40 hours/week job at a higher rate at 1-year follow-up. Women evidenced a higher rate of health care-seeking behaviors from new providers. On physical testing immediately after treatment, men had a significantly higher cumulative physical score (gender normalized), both before and after treatment. On depression and disability questionnaires, men showed fewer pre- and posttreatment depressive symptoms with lower pretreatment disability scores. Conclusions: The present study represents the first large-scale examination of the relationship between gender and treatment outcomes for a population with CDSD after work injuries. There was a pattern of moderately better 1-year posttreatment socioeconomic outcome for men. On psychosocial measures, men showed lower disability and depression scores than women, with higher levels of physical functioning both before and after treatment. Overall, male patients with CDSD appeared to show somewhat better biopsychosocial outcomes. This leaves the question of identifying gender-specific risk factors to explain these differences. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of a multidisciplinary day treatment program on complex regional pain syndrome (CPRS) were examined. Participants included 11 adults with a history of CPRS of 6 months or longer. A variety of measures were taken at admission, discharge, and follow-up from 6 to 32 months. Multidisciplinary treatments used included physical therapy, occupational therapy, stress management, biofeedback, goal oriented cognitively based individual, group, and family counseling, sympathetic blocks, medication management, behavioral modification, pain management, nutritional education, and case management. Variables assessed at admission and discharge included physical and occupational therapy ratings, thermal biofeedback levels, self-reported pain levels, depression and somatic distress levels, narcotic use, and vocation status. At post-discharge follow-up, which ranged from 6 to 30 months, pain levels, vocational status, and narcotic use were assessed. It was hypothesized that results would show improvement across all measures at post-treatment with maintenance of improvement at followup. Results support the hypothesis that multidisciplinary treatment of CPRS is effective in the improvement of symptomatology.

AB  - Fifty-six chronic pain patients were personally interviewed 18 months to 10 years after treatment in a multidisciplinary pain program. Compared to pretreatment data, there were significant decreases in medication use, hospitalizations, surgeries, pain levels, litigation, and compensation. Significantly more patients were employed at follow-up. Patients rated their disability, activity level, and ability to meet social and recreational needs as improved, even though adherence to the treatment program following discharge was poor. Only 25% of the subjects still consulted physicians for their pain problems. Multivariate analysis of admission MMPI scores indicated no significant differences between the successfully and unsuccessfully treated groups.

AB  - Background and aim: The present study reports on chronic non-cancer patients who were referred to a private pain clinic, according to a waiting time guarantee and treated within one month from referral. Based on evaluation by members of the multidisciplinary staff at our pain clinic a pain management program could be offered individually or as group therapy. Methods: Health related quality of life, psychometric tests, use of pain medication; socio-economic status and number of consultations in general practice were recorded at referral to the clinic and by postal questionnaires at follow-up 21 months later. The primary treatment outcome (treatment success) was defined as an improvement of at least 40 points in the physical component and/or the mental component of SF-36 from baseline to follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were changes in Beck's Anxiety Inventory and Beck's Depression Inventory, use of analgesics, work status and transfer income and number of consultations at the GP's office due to the chronic pain condition. Results: A total of 306 patients were included: 141 were treated individually and 165 were treated in groups. At follow-up, data were obtained from 189 patients (62%). Comparing baseline to follow-up data, 62% of group treated patients were treated successfully, compared with 41% of individually treated patients. Anxiety and depression were significantly improved in group treated patients but not in those treated individually. Significantly more patients had work income (and less patients transfer income) among group treated, compared with individually treated. At follow-up use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants was increased whereas use of tranquilizers and strong opioids was decreased in all patients. Number of consultations at their GPs due to chronic pain was significantly reduced in all patients. Conclusions: Multidisciplinary treatment in a private pain clinic seems to have a long-term effect in relation to biological, psychological and social aspects of the chronic pain condition. Treatments based on group therapy may offer better results than individual treatment courses. Implications: The effect of group therapy should be explored further.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to monitor the outcome of a five-week cognitive-behavioral interdisciplinary rehabilitation program for patients disabled by chronic pain, utilizing data collected for a national quality registry. METHODS: The study included 255 consecutive patients from a university hospital setting. Demographic data and patient beliefs about recovery recorded on a five-category scale were collected before the program. Pain intensity (VAS), Disability Rating Index (DRI) and life satisfaction (LiSat-11) were collected before, immediately after and one year after the program. Partial respondents and non-respondents were excluded;168 patients remained. RESULTS: Pain intensity decreased (''pain now''; Friedman's test, P<0.0001) by 13 mm (median) after the program, (Dunn's test; P<0.001) and by 5 mm after one year (P<0.05). Only one of twelve DRI items (activity), ''participating in exercise/sports'' improved significantly after rehabilitation (Wilcoxon's test; P=0.0009), and remained improved one year later (P=0.0144). Life satisfaction in the physical and psychological domains increased after the program. A clinically meaningful reduction in pain intensity (10 mm) was reported by 43% of patients at the one-year follow-up. This group had significant increases in life satisfaction. Only patients with positive beliefs about recovery before rehabilitation showed a decrease in pain intensity at the one-year follow-up (P<0.028). CONCLUSIONS: The program influenced the pain, life satisfaction and, to a small extent, activity. A clinically relevant pain reduction and an increase in life satisfaction were related. Patients' pretreatment beliefs about recovery influenced the long-term decrease of pain intensity, indicating that more attention should be focused on patients' pretreatment beliefs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine outcomes for 2 rehabilitation strategies for patients with chronic pain: a 2-day interdisciplinary team assessment followed by either: (i) a 4-week outpatient multimodal rehabilitation programme, or (ii) a subsequent rehabilitation plan. METHODS: After a 2-day interdisciplinary team assessment at our pain rehabilitation clinic 296 consecutive patients were selected to either multimodal rehabilitation (n = 76) or rehabilitation plan (n = 220). They completed questionnaires regarding pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), disability (Disability Rating Index), life satisfaction (LiSat-11), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) at assessment and again at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Both groups showed significant improvements at 1-year follow-up regarding pain intensity. In addition, the multimodal rehabilitation group improved in the disability items ("light work" and "heavy work"), depression and life satisfaction ("leisure", "somatic health", and "psychological health"). In the rehabilitation plan group "somatic health" improved, although not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that multimodal rehabilitation may have long-term positive effects on pain, disability, depression and domains of life satisfaction. However, a minor intervention, rehabilitation plan with follow-up in primary care, can improve pain and "somatic health". Based on the biopsychosocial approach, an interdisciplinary assessment of patients with chronic pain seems to be of value for selecting patients to different rehabilitation interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To follow up 2 rehabilitation strategies for patients with chronic pain: a 2-day interdisciplinary team assessment followed by either (i) a 4-week outpatient multimodal rehabilitation programme, or (ii) a subsequent rehabilitation plan. METHODS: After a 2-day interdisciplinary team assessment at our pain rehabilitation clinic, 296 consecutive patients were selected to undergo either multimodal rehabilitation programme (n = 76) or rehabilitation plan (n = 220). They completed questionnaires regarding beliefs about the future (only at assessment), Multidimensional Pain Inventory and sick leave, both at assessment, and at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Both the rehabilitation plan and multimodal rehabilitation programme groups improved significantly as regards decreased sick leave and the Multidimensional Pain Inventory scales Pain severity, Interference, and Support. The multimodal rehabilitation programme group also improved significantly regarding Life control and Affective distress. For men, low disability level and for women a positive expectation about work was associated with no sick leave at follow-up. CONCLUSION: The multimodal rehabilitation programme had long-term positive effects on sick leave and all Multidimensional Pain Inventory scales. However, a less intense intervention (rehabilitation plan) with follow-up in primary care can decrease levels of sick leave and improve some Multidimensional Pain Inventory scales. An interdisciplinary team assessment of patients with chronic pain seems to be useful for selecting which patients should undergo different rehabilitation interventions.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether treatment related pain reduction on the short- and long-term is predicted by different baseline variables, and with different accuracy, in patients with chronic low back pain as compared with those with chronic neck pain. Design and Methods: A single blinded prospective cohort study based on patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain in the lower back (N=167) or the neck (N=136) who completed a 4-week multimodal rehabilitation program. At admission, each patient was evaluated on 17 potential predictors, including pain characteristics and physical, sociodemographic, and psychosocial-behavioral variables. Changes in self-reported pain intensity in the lower back or the neck between the pretreatment evaluation and those performed immediately after, and 12 months after the rehabilitation program, were assessed. Results: Logistic regression models revealed that change in pain intensity could be predicted with good specificity but with poor sensitivity both for patients with chronic low back pain and chronic neck pain. Significant predictors among the neck pain patients were high endurance, low age, high pain intensity, few other symptoms, low need of being social, to do things with others, and to be helped, along with optimistic attitudes on how the pain will interfere with daily life. Among the low back pain patients, high pain intensity, low levels of pain severity, and high affective distress were important predictors. Variables such as sex, sick leave history, working status, accident, pain duration, and depressive symptoms demonstrated no predictive value. Short- and long-term pain outcome was equally predictable and predicted by almost the same variables. Conclusions: Patients who reported unchanged or increased pain after multimodal treatment could be predicted with good accuracy, whereas those who reported decreased pain were more difficult to identify. Treatment-related pain alteration in chronic low back pain seems to be predicted by partly different variables than in chronic neck pain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is often associated with clinical and subclinical levels of psychological problems. A higher stage of chronicity is associated with an increase in co-existing psychological disorders. Previous programmes of inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation reveal little evidence of sustained rehabilitation effects, a finding which may be attributable to the absence of specific psychological treatment during the programme. Purpose: Does cognitive-behavioural depression management training in patients with CLBP and depressive symptoms improve the inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation success depending on the stage of chronicity? Method: Effects of the new programme on psychological well-being (ADS depressive symptoms, HADS anxiety, SCL somatization and mental health of the SF-12) were investigated in n=75 patients with first and second stage of chronicity immediately after, six months after and 24 months after rehabilitation and were compared to standard rehabilitation without management of depressive symptoms. Results: All patients benefited from both treatments immediately after rehabilitation. However, six months after rehabilitation only patients of the intervention group showed significant beneficial effects with regard to depressive symptoms and mental health. The lowered depressive symptoms remained stable up to the 24-month follow-up assessment. Anxiety in the second stage of chronicity was reduced up to the 6-month follow-up and in the first stage up to the 24-month follow-up. Conclusions: The new programme with a cognitive-behavioural depression management training revealed beneficial effects on mental health in the mid-term and on depressive symptoms in the long-term. However, the effects need to be further improved by after-care programmes. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of a group-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme on disability, pain and quality of life in subjects with chronic neck pain. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Specialized rehabilitation centre. Subjects: A total of 170 patients (mean age of 53 years (13); 121 females). Interventions: The multidisciplinary group underwent a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme combining multimodal exercises with psychologist-lead cognitive-behavioural therapy sessions. The general exercise group underwent general physiotherapy. Both groups followed group-based programmes once a week for ten weeks. Additionally, the multidisciplinary group met with the psychologist once a week for a 60-minute session. Main measures: The Neck Disability Index (primary outcome), the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, a pain numerical rating scale and the Short-Form Health Survey. The participants were evaluated before, after training and after 12 months. Results: A linear mixed model for repeated measures was used for each outcome measure. Significant effects (p-value <0.001) were found over time and between groups for all outcome measures. After training, significant improvements were found for both groups for all outcome measures except kinesiophobia and catastrophizing, which did not change in the control group; however, the improvements were significantly greater for the multidisciplinary group. At 12-month follow-up a clinically meaningful between-group difference of 12.4 Neck Disability Index points was found for disability. Conclusions: A group-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme including cognitive-behavioural therapy was superior to group-based general physiotherapy in improving disability, pain and quality of life of subjects with chronic neck pain. The effects lasted for at least one year. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - PURPOSE: Although there is growing evidence in favour of the bio-psychosocial approach to the treatment of persistent neck pain, it is questioned whether treating psychological factors can improve patient perceptions of disability, pain and quality of life. This randomised, controlled study with 12 months' follow-up was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of adding cognitive-behavioural principles to exercises for chronic neck pain. METHODS: Eighty patients were randomly assigned to the usual neck exercises plus cognitive-behavioural treatment (PTcb group, 40 subjects) or to treatment based on neck exercises alone (PT group, 40 subjects). Before treatment (T1), at the end of treatment (T2) and 12 months later (T3), all of the patients completed a booklet including the Neck Pain and Disability Scale, a numerical rating scale, and the Short-Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). RESULTS: The present trial failed to demonstrate its primary end point: the pre- and post-treatment difference in total NPDS scores was not statistically different between groups. Disability improved similarly in both groups over time, remaining stable until T3 in the PTcb group and slightly increasing at the same time in the PT group. Pain trends were comparable, with both groups showing an improvement between T1 and T2, and a slight worsening between T2 and T3. There were significant increases in all of the SF-36 domains except for health in general, and vitality in both groups by the end of treatment. SF-36 showed a between-group difference only for the physical activity domain (10.4; 95% CI 2.4-18.5). CONCLUSION: Disability, pain and quality of life improved at the end of treatment in both groups, without differences between them.

AB  - This prospective observational cohort study addressed the long-term clinical effectiveness of the management of chronic neuropathic noncancer pain at 7 Canadian tertiary pain centers. Patients were treated according to standard guidelines and were followed at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Standard outcome measures for pain, mood, quality of life, and overall treatment satisfaction were administered, with the primary outcome measure designated as the composite of 30% reduction in average pain intensity and 1-point decrease in the mean Interference Scale Score (0â€“10) of the Brief Pain Inventory at 12 months relative to baseline. Of 789 patients recruited, mean age was 53.5 Â± 14.2 years (55% female) and mean duration of pain was 4.88 Â± 5.82 years. Mean average pain intensity (0â€“10) at baseline was 6.1 Â± 1.9. All standard outcome measures showed statistically significant improvement at 12 months relative to baseline (P < .001). However, only 23.7% attained clinically significant improvement in pain and function at 12 months as the primary outcome measure. Univariable analyses showed poorer outcomes at 12-month follow-up with longer duration of pain (P = .002), greater cigarette use (P = .01), more disability compensation (P = .001), and higher opioid doses at baseline and at 12 months (P < .02). Our present treatment modalities provide significant long-term benefit in only about a quarter of patients with neuropathic pain managed at tertiary care pain clinics. Opioid therapy may not be beneficial for the long term. Perspective: Evidence-based treatment of chronic neuropathic pain provides long-term benefit in only about one-quarter of patients seen in tertiary care centers. Opioid therapy may not be beneficial.

AB  - Objectives: In order to maximize the therapeutic benefits of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for chronic pain, individuals need to be motivated to adopt a self-management approach. The Pain Stages of Change Questionnaire (PSOCQ) was developed to measure patients' readiness to adopt a self-management approach to chronic pain. The present study examined whether pretreatment and posttreatment PSOCQ change scores among chronic low back pain patients could predict 6- and 12-month follow-up outcomes, and the stability of posttreatment PSOCQ scores during follow-up.Methods: Participants were recruited from a VA primary care clinic. Data from 60 participants assigned to either regular CBT or a modified CBT (ie, PRIME CBT) condition were analyzed in the present study. Self-report measures including PSOCQ, pain severity, disability, and depressive symptom severity were administered at pretreatment, 10 weeks posttreatment, 6-month and follow-up assessments.Results: Multiple regression analyses showed that pretreatment and posttreatment changes in the Action/Maintenance scores significantly predicted pain severity at 6 months, and changes in the Precontemplation scores significantly predicted disability at 6 months. None of the PSOCQ change scores significantly predicted depressive symptom severity. Posttreatment Precontemplation and Action/Maintenance scores were quite stable, even at 12-month follow-up.Conclusions: Changes in patients' attitudes toward adopting a pain self-management approach may serve as one of the therapeutic mechanisms and predict long-term function. This study also revealed that changed attitudes toward chronic pain self-management remain quite stable over time. Adoption of beliefs consistent with chronic pain self-management during treatment may promote sustained benefits.

AB  - The efficacy of intensive interdisciplinary pain management programs for patients with chronic low back pain has been repeatedly demonstrated. A controversial issue in previous studies is the cost-effectiveness of this treatment. Between 2001 and 2006, a total of 575 patients with chronic nonspecific back pain took part in an outpatient pain management program at the German Red Cross Pain Center (DRK Schmerz-Zentrum Mainz) in Mainz, Germany. Complete follow-up data were available for 351 patients 1 year after the end of treatment and were included in the study. No differences between these patients and the dropouts were found. Pain, impairment, and mental well-being had significantly improved after 1 year. For employed patients, the number of absent days decreased to almost one-quarter. On the basis of the study by Wenig, who calculated pain-related costs as a function of Von Korff pain grades, the treatment resulted in a savings of 3,329.50 per year per patient. Intensive multidisciplinary treatment of chronic back pain is highly effective and, at least for patients with high levels of disability, is also cost-effective. © 2009 Springer Medizin Verlag.

AB  - Background: Behavioural exposure methods can reduce pain-avoidance behaviours, but outcomes vary. One possible explanation is that patients employ cognitive (experiential) avoidance during behavioural exposure. If so, reducing cognitive avoidance during behavioural exposure should help. One option is interoceptive exposure (IE), which involves sustained exposure (via attention) to pain sensations. In order to test if IE could improve outcomes from behavioural exposure, this study with mixed chronic pain patients compared outcomes from a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) pain management programme incorporating either IE or distraction from pain. Methods: One hundred forty chronic pain patients were randomly assigned to CBT + IE or CBT + distraction. Outcome measures included pain, disability, depression and medication. Measures reflecting degree of threat of pain were also employed (catastrophizing, fear-avoidance, pain self-efficacy and pain acceptance). An intention-to-treat approach, using mixed-effects model repeated measures, as well as conventional inferential statistical tests, effect sizes and reliable change indices were employed to evaluate the outcomes up to 1-year post-treatment. Results: Significant improvements were achieved by both treatment conditions on all outcome measures and on measures reflecting the threatening nature of pain, with no differences between treatment conditions. Conclusions: The addition of IE to behavioural exposure did not improve outcomes. However, higher adherence to either attentional strategy was associated with larger effect sizes on all measures, suggesting factors shared by the two treatments could have contributed to the outcomes. Taken as a whole, the results suggest that increasing adherence to treatment strategies, possibly by motivational measures, would improve the overall outcomes of these interventions.

AB  - Background: It is often suggested that immigrants with long-term pain do not benefit from rehabilitation to the same extent as native Swedish patients. In this study, an 8-week rehabilitation programme was evaluated according to its adaptation for immigrants. Objectives: To establish whether there is a difference between immigrants and native Swedes concerning: (i) return-to-work, the patients' own estimation and their actual ability; (ii) higher level of activity; (iii) reduction in pain and analgesic use. Patients. A total of 67 patients with persistent non-malignant pain completed the rehabilitation programme. Thirty (45%) of the patients were immigrants. Methods: A 1- and a 3-year follow-up were made to compare the outcome between the 2 groups. Results: There was no significant difference in the return-to-work rate between immigrants and native Swedes. However, the patients' prediction of their ability to return to work was higher among the non-immigrants. The level of activity was lower and pain intensity and use of analgesics were higher among the immigrants than the non-immigrants. Conclusion: Immigrants can benefit from a rehabilitation programme to the same extent as native Swedes concerning return-to-work rate, but seem to have limitations in assimilating the other objectives of the programme. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Chronic Pain Section at Reykjalundur has 33 beds for patients with various chronic pain problems. About 200 patients are treated annually. For 3 years, 158 patients were enrolled in a random study focusing on increasing the patients' functioning and eliminating analgesic drugs through an interdisciplinary rehabilitation program. Patients answered a questionnaire at admission, before discharge from the clinic and about one year after discharge. The follow-up was done with a mailed questionnaire. The focus was on the patients' functioning rather than absence of pain. The program's duration was 7 weeks. The first 2 weeks were utilized for evaluation, information and education (pain school). Pain relieving drugs were gradually withdrawn but anti-inflammatory drugs were used when indicated. Cognitive behavioral therapy was applied in an increasing number of cases over the 3 year period by specially trained nurses and a psychiatrist. Pain, anxiety and depression were self-evaluated on a numeric rating scale (NRS). About 50% of the patients had a history of pain for more than 5 years. Low back pain was the most common diagnosis (48.1%) and 28.5% had post-traumatic pain. A significant reduction in pain, anxiety and depression was found both at discharge (p < 0.0001) and at follow-up (p < 0.001). Before entering the program, only 18.4% of the patients were able to work whereas 48.1% returned to work after discharge and 59.2% were working at follow-up.

AB  - Purpose: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is known to be effective for treating depression and anxiety in patients with chronic pain, but there is limited research studying the long-term benefits of CBT in this population. The present study evaluated the effects of CBT provided in the context of an interdisciplinary pain management program with a 3-year follow-up.Methods: One hundred fifteen patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain participated in an interdisciplinary pain management program. Eighty of these patients meeting criteria for CBT treatment were randomized to receive or not receive CBT for depression and anxiety in addition to rehabilitation pain management. The remaining 35 patients constituted a second comparison group. Follow-up data were collected 1 and 3 years post-treatment with 19% of the patients dropping out after 1 year and 34% after 3 years. Attrition analysis did not indicate that there was significant attrition bias in the data.Results: All three groups evidenced improved depression following treatment (p < 0.001). The pre- to post-treatment effect sizes (Cohen’s d) for depression in the CBT treatment group was large (ES = 1.36). The CBT treatment group maintained improvements on all measures at a 3-year follow-up, while the comparison groups did not. This was especially evident with respect to depression (pre-treatment to 3 years follow-up ES = 1.35 and between-group ES = 0.57). Before treatment, 36% of all the patients reported that they were able to work. At 3 years post-treatment, 59%, 58%, and 44% of the patients were working who were in the CBT treatment group, the Comparison group, and the Non-CBT group, respectively.Conclusion: The results indicate that providing CBT for depression and anxiety as part of a rehabilitation pain management program may enhance the long-term benefits of treatment. This finding, if replicated in additional studies, has important clinical and economic implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The psychological health of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) influences their response to a number of conservative and invasive pain treatments. However, evidence is still scarce regarding the impact of anxiety and depression in the clinical outcomes of multidisciplinary pain management over time. This study, based on longitudinal data from a clinical practice setting, aimed to assess the effectiveness of the usual multidisciplinary approach provided to CLBP patients and to explore the impact of anxiety and depression symptoms and their interaction on clinical outcomes. METHOD(S): In this study, participants included were adult patients in their first consultation in a multidisciplinary chronic pain clinic. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Shortened Treatment Outcomes in Pain Survey (S-TOPS) were used to assess outcomes. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess the impact of anxiety, depression, and their interaction on treatment outcomes. RESULT(S): A total of 284 patients (age 60.4+/-13.7years, 74.6% female) with CLBP were included at baseline. The majority of patients had both anxiety and depression and experienced higher pain severity (P<0.001) and higher pain-related disability (P<0.001). Anxiety and depression mainly predicted changes in pain interference over time. Their interaction significantly predicted changes in pain interference. CONCLUSION(S): Anxiety, depression, and their interaction are associated with changes in pain disability at one-year follow-up. These findings encourage the pretreatment screening of anxiety and depression as independent symptoms in patients with CLBP in order to design more tailored and effective multidisciplinary treatments.

AB  - We examined the relative impact of baseline anxiety, depression and fear of movement on health related quality of life at 12-month follow-up after a multidisciplinary pain management programme. One hundred and eleven patients who had chronic musculoskeletal pain (mean age 45 years, 65% women) attended during 2003–2005 a multidisciplinary three-phase pain management programme with a total time frame of six to seven months, totalling 19 days. The Beck Anxiety Inventory was used to rate anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory depression, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia fear of movement. The generic 15D questionnaire was used to assess health related quality of life. Baseline data were collected at admission, follow-up data at 12 months. Mean health related quality of life increased significantly from baseline to 12-month follow-up. Anxiety at baseline predicted significant negative change in the health related quality of life, depression predicted significant positive change in the health related quality of life. Fear of movement did not predict any significant change in the health related quality of life. We concluded that patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and mild to moderate depression benefit from a multidisciplinary pain management programme in contrast to anxious patients. The findings imply further research with bigger sample sizes, other than HRQoL outcome measures as well as with other groups of patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Chronic pain, a debilitating medical condition affecting approximately 15% of the US population, leads to individual suffering and costs to society in terms of health care dollars and lost productivity. To examine the effectiveness of a comprehensive pain management program, data from 108 program participants were evaluated. Preprogram, postprogram, and 6-month follow-up data were collected from 80 participants, and preprogram, postprogram, and 1-year data were collected from 46 participants. Outcomes data from several domains were assessed: pain severity, emotional distress, interference of pain on function, perceived control of pain, treatment helpfulness, and number of hours resting. Within-subject repeated-measure analyses of variance found statistically significant findings on the six outcome measures utilized in this study for both the 6-month and 1-year samples. Examination of 95% confidence intervals revealed no overlap in pretreatment scores with 6-month and 1-year outcomes in five of the six domains studied. Mean scores on emotional distress did not maintain statistical significance in the 6-month or 1-year review. Overall, this study strengthens the case for interdisciplinary care for chronic pain management and provides evidence for the long-term effectiveness of this therapy. Furthermore, this study lends support to the notion that interdisciplinary treatments are effective in targeting multiple domains affected by the pain condition.

AB  - Objectives. The study objectives were to identify baseline predictors of low back pain severity changes over a one-year period among patients attending multidisciplinary tertiary clinics and determine whether health care utilization impacts this outcome. Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study using the Quebec Pain Registry (QPR). A total of 686 low back pain (LBP) patients (55.8% females, mean age 1/4 56.51 6 14.5 years) from the QPR were selected for this study. Patients completed self-report questionnaires and nurse-administered questionnaires before their first appointment at a multidisciplinary pain treatment center. Analysis was conducted using a linear growth model. Results. There was a modest (10%) improvement in pain severity scores over a 12-month period. Pain catastrophizing and depressive symptoms predicted higher baseline levels of pain severity (P < 0.001). Having used self-management approaches over the past six months was associated with higher levels of pain severity at 12 months (P < 0.001). Discussion. Results from this study showed no clear pattern of association between the use of different treatment disciplines and pain severiy over the first year after multidisciplinary treatment intervention. These results raise an important question as to the best way of utilizing scarce multidisciplinary resources to optimize cost-effectiveness and improve outcomes among complex, chronic LBP patients.

AB  - Study Design. Patients completing a multidisciplinary pain treatment were contacted to obtain 13-year follow-up information on pain, mood, employment, and general health. Objectives. Study objectives were to determine if posttreatment improvements were maintained over a lengthy follow-up period and to compare patients' general health to norms of comparably aged persons. Summary of Background Data. Although many studies have demonstrated the short-term effectiveness of multidisciplinary pain treatment programs for chronic low back pain, few studies have documented that these treatment gains are maintained over time. Only two studies have reported patient outcomes on a long-term basis (10+ years). Those studies have documented that patient gains during treatment are generally maintained during follow-up. Methods. An attempt was made to contact all patients completing an inpatient chronic back pain rehabilitation program at the University of Iowa's Spine Diagnostic and Treatment Center. Of the 45 participants, 28 were located and 26 agreed to participate in a telephone interview. Analyses of pretreatment and posttreatment data revealed these follow-up participants did not differ from the larger study sample. Results. Patients maintained their treatment gains in all areas (pain intensity and interference, negative mood). Additionally, patients showed levels of general health comparable to similarly aged peers with the exceptions of pain (more pain) and physical functioning (lower functioning, more pain interference). More than half the sample was employed; of those not employed, few reported this was due to pain. Conclusions. The data lend support to the long-term effectiveness of multidisciplinary treatment programs for chronic low back pain.

AB  - This study reports a 9-18 month follow-up of a randomised controlled trial of pain management programmes for chronic, non-malignant pain. Twenty-two inpatients, 18 outpatients and 12 control subjects completed the follow-up assessments. Significant treatment effects were demonstrated by the inpatient group on pain ratings, the Pain Behaviour Checklist, and General Health Questionnaire, with similar effects demonstrated by the outpatient group on the former 2 measures. The findings were confounded by higher inpatient scores at pretreatment, in comparison with the 2 other conditions. There was a high drop-out rate of subjects, particularly from the control condition which illustrates the limitations of controlled group designs in this area. Analgesic use, activity levels and pain ratings were also evaluated using the criteria for 'success' described by Malec et al. (1981). Results indicated that 68% of inpatients, 61% of outpatients and 21% of control subjects met all 3 criteria. Both treatment programmes were effective in returning patients to paid employment, whilst 3 control group patients gave up work. The cost-benefit implications of these changes are discussed. We conclude that pain management programmes contribute substantially to the rehabilitation of chronic pain sufferers.

AB  - Aim of the study: Treatment of chronic low back pain is a difficult problem and usually of low effectiveness. Aim of the study was to analyse the effectiveness of a multimodal treatment procedure. Methods: From the basis of functional restoration concepts primarily established in the USA we conceptualized a treatment program which initially was funded by the German ministry of research. Over the years the regimen was modified in several respects (programs of different intensity). From 1990 to 2000 762 patients were treated in this way with one-year follow-up examination. Results: Patients who were off work had significant differences in psychosocial and pain-related variables in comparison to those patients who were still working. Treatment procedures were in general very effective, although a modification of the program with less treatment (no work-hardening) failed in repeating the same effects. Pain intensity, disability, amount of depression and psychological distress improved significantly as well as work capability and use of the health care system. Nearly all results were seen to stabilize at the 12-month evaluation. Discussion: Functional restoration programs for treatment of chronic low back pain have demonstrated effectiveness in several countries. By early use of these programs the high amount of costs due to back pain disability may be consequently reduced. Up to now in Germany these concepts are not wellknown and insurance companies as well as the health system do not yet acknowledge them.

AB  - Problem: Studies using a multimodal approach in order to prognose therapeutic success in patients suffering from back pain were seen to have highly diverse results. However, in spite of various independent health care systems, a common interest prevails in identifying determinants of therapeutic success in order to improve therapy. Methods: Ninety disabled patients with chronic low back pain were admitted to an 8-week out-patient program of functional restoration and behavioral support. The program consisted of a pre-program (education, stretching and calisthenic exercises 4 h a day, three times a week for 3 weeks) and an intensive treatment period (physical exercises, back school education, cognitive behavioral group therapy, relaxation training, occupational therapy, socioeconomic and vocational counseling) which took place for 5 weeks, 7 h a day as an outpatient program. The program's philosophy encourages active effort on the patients' part in order to improve their functional status within a therapeutic environment. This reinforces behavior conducive to getting well, enhances the patients' sense of self-control over their pain and the resulting disability. The main therapeutic target was to facilitate the patients' return to work. Apart from medical examination and personal interview, the patients' physical impairment, pain descriptions, and psychological distress were also measured. This included variables such as depression, psychovegetative complaints, guality of life and workplace satisfaction, disability, and coping with disease. Measurements were repeated at the end of the 8-week program, and following 6 and 12 month intervals. The reliability of prognostic factors in predicting treatment outcome (return to work, reduction of pain intensity, self-assessment of success by the patients) was tested by analyses of variance and discriminant function analyses. Results: Patients' return to the workplace could be predicted in 85% of cases based on whether an application for pension had been made, on the length of duration of work disability, and on 'fixed' assumptions on the part of the patient concerning his work situation. Pre-treatment somatic findings (for example, diagnosis, degree of physical impairment, and functional debilities), together with depressive and psychovegetative reactions, were shown to have no connection with the patient's ability to return to the workplace. Similar findings were demonstrated for the prediction of pain reduction and patient satisfaction with treatment. Conclusions: Predicting successful treatment is hardly possible without analyzing individual circumstances, focusing on sociodemographic variables, workplace-related conditions, and aspects of individual motivation. With regard to objective therapeutic success, subjective perceptions proved highly influential. Treatment proved successful only when the patient's perception of functional disability was minimized. Hence, individual perceptions and experiences were more important than physical capabilities.

AB  - PURPOSE: This longitudinal study investigated long-term effects of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program consisting of resistance and sensorimotor training, patient education, and stress management over 6 months in patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS: Ninety-six patients with chronic recurrent low back pain performed a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. We assessed pain-free lumbar spine range of motion (ROM), strength of the lumbar extensor muscles, and pain by visual analog scale (VAS). Furthermore, the Roland-Morris (RM) questionnaire and SF-36 were used. The examinations were performed before and after rehabilitation, and a long-term follow-up was performed after 18 months. RESULTS: All outcome measurements (ROM, VAS, RM, muscle strength, and SF-36 scores) improved significantly from baseline to the post-rehabilitation evaluation. These improvements were found to persist until a follow-up evaluation 18 months after cessation of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the results of former studies evaluating the short-term effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs. In addition, our data demonstrate that well-balanced outpatient rehabilitation programs may induce persistent improvements in muscle strength, pain, function and quality of life in patients with chronic low back pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the outcomes 1 year after multimodal rehabilitation programmes in primary care for patients with chronic pain, both as a whole and for men and women separately. A second aim was to identify predictive factors for not being on sickness absence at follow-up after 1 year. METHOD(S): A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 234 patients, 34 men and 200 women, age range 18-65 years, who participated in multimodal rehabilitation programmes in primary care in 2 Swedish county councils. Pain, physical and emotional functioning, coping, health-related quality of life, work-related factors, sickness absence (sick leave, sickness compensation/disability pension) were evaluated prior to and 1 year after multimodal rehabilitation programmes. RESULT(S): Patients showed significant improvements at 1-year follow-up for all measures (all p<=0.004) except satisfaction with vocation (p=0.060). The proportion of patients on sick leave decreased significantly at follow-up (p=0.027), while there was no significant difference regarding the proportion of patients on sickness compensation/disability pension (p=0.087). Higher self-rated work ability was associated with not being on sickness absence at 1-year follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 1.19, confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.06, p=0.005). CONCLUSION(S): This study indicates that multimodal rehabilitation programmes in primary care could be beneficial for patients with chronic pain, since the outcomes at 1-year follow-up for pain, physical and emotional functioning, coping, and health-related quality of life were positive. However, the effect sizes were small and thus further development of multimodal rehabilitation programmes is warranted in order to improve the outcomes.

AB  - Evaluation of a functional restoration program for severely handicapped chronic low back pain patients: a 1-year follow-up study. Objective: Evaluation after 1 year of a functional restoration program for severely handicapped chronic low back pain patients. Patients and methods: Open prospective study with a 1 year follow-up period evaluating the efficacy of a 5 week functional restoration program. The main components of this program are specific exercises to increase trunk, lower and upper limb muscles flexibility and strength, training in functional tasks, education and work endurance. The primary outcome measure is the ability to return to work. Inclusion criteria are: at least 4 months of continuous disability from work because of back pain; no evident medically or surgically remediable lesion; the absence of contraindication for heavy exercises. The main exclusion criteria was unemployment. Results: Thirty-five patients, 24 men aged 40 (range: 22-55) were enrolled. The average number of months since last working was 13 (range: 4-30). Fifteen patients had at least one back surgery. After 1 year, 24 (66%) of the population returned to work. During the 1-year follow-up period, nine patients had to stop their work because of back pain with a mean duration of 64 days (range: 15-240 days). The mean duration of the out of work period in the whole population during the year following the program was reduced by 52% (142 days vs 296 days) when compared to the year before the program. At the end of the program, pain intensity was not significantly modified. Muscle strength and flexibility were significantly increased. Depression, anxiety and functional scales were significantly decreased. Conclusion: This intensive rehabilitation program appears to be useful even if its evaluation needs further multicentric studies including a control group. (C) 1999 Elsevier, Paris.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare comprehensively the likelihood of various socioeconomically relevant outcomes between functional restoration completers and noncompleters, while simultaneously identifying risk factors for noncompletion. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of patients with chronic disabling occupational musculoskeletal disorders (CDOMD). SETTING: Chronic pain management facility. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1440 patients with CDOMD were consecutively divided into 2 groups-one with 303 patients who did not complete the prescribed treatment program (noncompleters [NC]) and a second with 1137 patients who did (completers). INTERVENTION: The Interdisciplinary Functional Restoration: Rehabilitation program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Validated questionnaires about pain, disability, and depression were added to results of a structured 1-year posttreatment telephone interview on socioeconomic outcomes covering work status, health utilization, recurrent injury claims, and resolution of financial disputes. RESULTS: The 1-year posttreatment socioeconomic outcomes were most striking. The NC group was 7 times more likely to have postrehabilitation surgery in the same area, and nearly 7 times more likely to have more than 30 visits to a new health provider in persistent health care-seeking efforts. The NC group also had only half the rates of work return and work retention, being 9.7 times less likely to have returned to any type of work, and 7 times less likely to have retained work at the end of the year. Regression analysis also revealed that work return, surgery in a compensable injured area, more health care utilization from a new provider, and more overall health care utilization (>30 visits) were most reliably predicted by whether the rehabilitation program was completed. CONCLUSIONS: This large prospective study determined that noncompleters of interdisciplinary tertiary rehabilitation for CDOMDs had comparatively poor socioeconomic outcomes in the year after discharge from treatment, especially on work status and health utilization outcomes. These outcomes are of great relevance to societal, medical, and indemnity costs and future worker productivity. Several risk factors of possible importance in identifying potential noncompleters early in the treatment program were identified that may yield more effective interventions tailored to maintain compliance and decrease the percentage of drop-outs.

AB  - Background: Interdisciplinary pain therapy is nowadays the state of the art for the treatment of chronic unspecific back pain. The aim of this article is to present the retrospective analysis of the data from a 1-week intensive outpatient multimodal interdisciplinary pain therapy group program for treatment of patients with chronic unspecific back pain. Design and methods: The questionnaire-based data from patients who attended the program were evaluated before as well as 3 and 12 months after finishing the program. The patients were questioned regarding parameters, such as pain severity, quality of life, pain-related disability, depression and pain acceptance. Results: On average a significant improvement of all parameters after 3 and 12 months could be demonstrated (excluding the domains "social" and "environment" in the context of quality of life). Discussion: Interestingly, the results showed a significant improvement of almost all evaluated parameters even after a period of 12 months (unfortunately only data for 41 patients were available). In our opinion this improvement is due to the special constellation of the presented program, which with 1 week is relatively short but very intensive with 34 h of treatment. In addition, the program is integrated into a long-term multimodal outpatient treatment, a concept in which the multimodal treatment is individually continued after the 1-week program. On the other hand, the results especially after 12 months have to be interpreted particularly in this context.Copyright © 2017, Deutsche Schmerzgesellschaft e.V.

AB  - This study examined changes in employment status and quality of work in 109 chronic pain patients who underwent a cognitive-behavioural pain management course; 68% of patients were female, mean age was 45 years, mean pain chronicity 10.7 years, 70% had spinal pain, and mean impairment on the Sickness Impact Profile was 26%. Twenty-six per cent of patients were employed at pre-treatment; the remaining 74% had been unemployed for 4.3 years on average. Measures of work status and quality, mood, pain, self-efficacy and walking performance were taken before admission, and at 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Among employed patients quality of work scores improved by 35% from pre- to post-treatment (p < 0.01). Thirty per cent of previously unemployed patients returned to work during the 1-year follow-up, although employment status fluctuated greatly during this period. Non-workers were generally more impaired than workers on most measures, but the same measures did not differentiate between those who successfully returned to work and those who remained unemployed.

AB  - Few studies have investigated the real-life outcomes of interdisciplinary multimodal pain rehabilitation programs (IMMRP) for chronic pain. This study has four aims: investigate effect sizes (ES); analyse correlation patterns of outcome changes; define a multivariate outcome measure; and investigate whether the clinical self-reported presentation pre-IMMRP predicts the multivariate outcome. To this end, this study analysed chronic pain patients in specialist care included in the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation for 22 outcomes (pain, psychological distress, participation, and health) on three occasions: pre-IMMRP, post-IMMRP, and 12-month follow-up. Moderate stable ES were demonstrated for pain intensity, interference in daily life, vitality, and health; most other outcomes showed small ES. Using a Multivariate Improvement Score (MIS), we identified three clusters. Cluster 1 had marked positive MIS and was associated with the overall worst situation pre-IMMRP. However, the pre-IMMRP situation could only predict 8% of the variation in MIS. Specialist care IMPRPs showed moderate ES for pain, interference, vitality, and health. Outcomes were best for patients with the worst clinical presentation pre-IMMRP. It was not possible to predict who would clinically benefit most from IMMRP.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate: (i) changes in sick-leave benefits from 1 year prior to multimodal rehabilitation to 1 and 2 years after rehabilitation; (ii) sex differences in sick leave; and (iii) the impact of policy changes on sick leave. METHOD(S): All patients undergoing multimodal rehabilitation registered in a national pain database for 2007-11 (n = 7,297) were linked to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency database. Sick leave was analysed in 3-month periods: T0: 1 year before rehabilitation; T1: before start; T2: 1 year after; and T3: 2 years after rehabilitation. Four sick-leave benefit categories were constructed: no sick leave, part-time sick leave, full-time sick leave, and full-time permanent sick leave. The individual change in sick-leave category at each time-period was analysed. RESULT(S): Sick-leave benefits increased from T0 to T1 (p < 0.001) and decreased from T1 to T3 (p < 0.001). Reductions were significant for both men and women from T1 to T3, but men had less sick-leave benefits at T2 and T3. Positive changes in sick-leave benefits at T2 and T3 were found both prior to and after policy changes, with less sick-leave benefits after policy changes at all time-points. CONCLUSION(S): Multimodal rehabilitation may positively influence sick-leave benefits for patients with chronic pain, regardless of their sick-leave situation, sex or policy changes.

AB  - Although interdisciplinary pain management programs are both therapeutically effective as well as cost-effective, they are currently being underutilized because of managed care policies. We used this pro-spective comparison trial, with 1-yr follow-up of chronic pain patients, to demonstrate the short- and long-term efficacy of an interdisciplinary pain management program, and evaluate the impact of managed care's physical therapy "carve out" practices on these treatment outcomes. Consecutive chronic pain patients (n = 201) were evaluated, some of whom had their physical therapy "carved out" from this integrated program. Results revealed that successful completion of interdisciplinary pain management was therapeutically effective. Most importantly, physical therapy "carved out" practices had a negative impact on both the short-term and 1-yr follow-up outcome measures. Thus, interdisciplinary pain management is effective in treating the major health problem of chronic pain. However, insurance carrier policies of contracting treatment "carve outs" significantly compromise the efficacy of this evidencebased, best standard of medical care treatment. This raises important medico-legal and ethical issues.

AB  - The current study evaluated treatment efficacy of interdisciplinary pain management by comparing the outcomes of treatment completers to treatment dropouts, as well as evaluating the effect of coping style differences and treatment 'carve out'. A total of 201 subjects participated in the study. The first component of the study involved comparisons between treatment completers and dropouts for measures of physical and psychosocial functioning, vocational status, medication usage, and healthcare utilization. At one-year follow-up, treatment completers showed significantly better physical and psychosocial functioning relative to dropouts, were better able to work, and used less opioid medication. In addition, treatment completers required medical attention significantly less often than dropouts in the year following treatment. Treatment completers also demonstrated significant gains from pretreatment to post-treatment for all parameters evaluated, and these gains were maintained at one-year follow-up. A model was created to predict classification of subjects as completers or dropouts that was accurate in predicting group membership in 69.8% of the cases. It was noted that further research is necessary to further clarify risk factors for dropout, as well as to examine differential treatment response in chronic pain patient subgroups. The second component of the study involved evaluating the effect of treatment on patient subgroups. Differences in functioning among the three Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) coping styles were noted at pretreatment, but disappeared at post-treatment. However, at one-year follow-up, a differential treatment response was noted, with Adaptive copers showing better physical functioning than other coping styles. In addition, Dysfunctional copers exhibited better psychosocial functioning than Interpersonally Distressed copers. Finally, the third component of the study evaluated the effect of physical therapy insurance 'carve out' on treatment response at post-treatment and one-year follow-up. An effect was found for one of the measures of physical functioning, with patients who received physical therapy within the same clinic as the rest of their treatment program (PT in) showing significantly better functioning than those who were treated with physical therapy elsewhere (PT out). Also, the PT in group showed significant improvements in vocational status, whereas the PT out group did not. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the overall efficiency of an outpatient behavioral rehabilitation program for excess disability and chronic pain and to describe the program staff, treatment components and outcomes in sufficient detail to facilitate comparison with similar programs. DESIGN: Eight-year follow-up study of patients referred and treated. SETTING: Outpatient primary care and multispecialty group medical practice. PATIENTS: 354 of 421 unselected patients referred for the behavioral management of excess disability, who completed the treatment program and participated in follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: 15-20 sessions of physical and occupational therapy, 5-10 sessions of biofeedback, and one or two family sessions all based upon behavioral techniques described by Fordyce and by Roberts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaires, including analog scales, administered before treatment and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months posttreatment. RESULTS: Patients (n = 67) who dropped out did not differ systematically from those who participated (n = 354). The treatment program resulted in a marked and enduring reduction of pain, and a statistically and clinically significant improvement in patients' ability to function at work and in the home. Patients overwhelmingly endorsed the program. CONCLUSIONS: A brief, inexpensive, outpatient behavioral rehabilitation program for chronic pain and excess disability can achieve a clinically significant and lasting reduction of pain and improvement in function at work and at home.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Randomized parallel group comparative trial with a 1-year follow-up period. OBJECTIVE: To compare in a population of patients with chronic low back pain, the effectiveness of a functional restoration program (FRP), including intensive physical training and a multidisciplinary approach, with an outpatient active physiotherapy program at 1-year follow-up. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Controlled studies conducted in the United States and in Northern Europe showed a benefit of FRPs, especially on return to work. Randomized studies have compared these programs with standard care. A previously reported study presented the effectiveness at 6 months of both functional restoration and active physiotherapy, with a significantly greater reduction of sick-leave days for functional restoration. METHODS: A total of 132 patients with low back pain were randomized to either FRP (68 patients) or active individual therapy (64 patients). One patient did not complete the FRP; 19 patients were lost to follow-up (4 in the FRP group and 15 in the active individual treatment group). The number of sick-leave days in 2 years before the program was similar in both groups (180 +/- 135.1 days in active individual treatment vs. 185 +/- 149.8 days in FRP, P = 0.847). RESULTS: In both groups, at 1-year follow-up, intensity of pain, flexibility, trunk muscle endurance, Dallas daily activities and work and leisure scores, and number of sick-leave days were significantly improved compared with baseline. The number of sick-leave days was significantly lower in the FRP group. CONCLUSION: Both programs are efficient in reducing disability and sick-leave days. The FRP is significantly more effective in reducing sick-leave days. Further analysis is required to determine if this overweighs the difference in costs of both programs.

AB  - Objective: To compare the effectiveness of three treatment strategies for chronic low back pain with varying biomechanical intensity and multidisciplinary approach. Methods: A monocentric randomized controlled trial with a 12-months follow-up, conducted in the French Valley Loire region from May 2009 to April 2013. Participants were working-aged patients with chronic low back pain referred to a French chronic low back pain care-network to support medical and occupational issues. Three treatment strategies, each for five weeks were compared: (i) intensive and multidisciplinary program conducted in a rehabilitation center; (ii) less intensive outpatient program conducted by a trained private physiotherapist; (iii) mixed strategy combining the same outpatient program associated with a weekly multidisciplinary intervention. The effects of treatment conditions were compared using an 'intention to treat' approach: Number of days’ sick leave during the 12-months following treatment, and quality of life and social ability assessed by auto-questionnaires. Results: A total of 159 patients (58.9% men, 41.5 ± 10.3 years old, median duration of sick leave = 221.0 days (127.5–319.0)) were included. Sick leave duration significantly decreased during the 12-months following treatment in the three groups. There was no significant difference for the evolution of participants’ quality of life, social ability, and personal beliefs between the three groups. Conclusion: This study confirms that disparate treatments might show similar effectiveness because they could all work through concomitant changes in beliefs, attitudes, and coping mechanisms. The original mixed strategy can treat a larger number of chronic low back pain patients, at a lower cost and provide local community-based care.

AB  - 51 patients suffering chronic pain, with different diagnoses, were treated in groups as outpatients using a cognitive behavioural approach. Groups of 7-8 patients met for two hours a week for six weeks. The groups were led by a team consisting of a clinical psychologist, a physiotherapist and a doctor. The patients learned about different aspects of pain, self-exercise and relaxation by selfhypnosis. Group dynamics was used to strengthen self-esteem, facilitate learning and encourage a change of attitude towards pain. Each patient answered a questionnaire about activities, level of pain, drugs and psychological symptoms before and immediately after treatment, and at follow-up one year later. At follow-up, 43% were less depressed, 70% felt less pain and 50% were more active and used less drugs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a pretreatment multimodal (MM) assessment of patients with chronic muscular pain has an impact on treatment outcome. METHODS: The present randomized-controlled study evaluated an MM assessment compared with routine multidisciplinary assessment given to a control group. The study population consisted of primary care patients with mixed chronic muscular pain. Variables assessed were: pain intensity, depression, life stress, quality of life (QOL), disability, working ability, and treatment satisfaction. Follow-up was performed at 15 months and 182 patients of 220 (83%) completed the study. RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed from baseline to 15 months a significant improvement in QOL as measured by Short-Form 36 in the MM group compared with the control group on the domains of physical function (odds ratio 2.40; 95% confidence interval 1.32-4.37), role physical (2.37; 1.10-5.09), and role emotional (2.05; 1.05-3.96). Working ability improved more significantly in the MM group (46% vs. 35%) and impairment was less (1% vs. 15%) compared with the control group (P=0.016). Satisfaction with the assessment was, on average, higher (P<0.001) in the MM group than in the control group. DISCUSSION: Patients who underwent an MM assessment before treatment in comparison with patients receiving routine multidisciplinary assessment improved QOL, working ability, and were also significantly more satisfied. This result indicates that MM pretreatment assessment could be advantageous in the selection of patients for suitable rehabilitation treatment in a primary care setting, and also be used to prepare patients for future rehabilitation.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the long-term effects of multidisciplinary allocation of pain treatment on pain intensity, functional disability, depression, and medication use in outpatients with chronic pain, and to identify cognitive-behavioral predictors worrying, avoidance behavior, fear of pain, helplessness, and acceptance] of the primary outcome measures. Methods: Eighty-six outpatients with chronic pain who were treated at a multidisciplinary pain center completed various questionnaires and a pain diary one week before treatment started, and 3 and 12 months later. Results: Functional disability and depression improved significantly 12 months after the start of treatment in comparison with before treatment. The decrease in scores for the cognitive behavioral variables worrying, fear of pain, helplessness, and avoidance behavior at three months was associated with the decrease in functional disability and depression at 12 months. Conclusion: Patients with chronic pain may benefit in the long term from multidisciplinary allocation to pain treatment with respect to functional disability and depression. Changes of cognitive-behavioral processes seem to contribute to achieving long-term effects of multidisciplinary allocation of pain treatment. There is a need for high quality clinical trials in this field in order to clarify the specific contribution of cognitive-behavioral process variables.

AB  - Problem: There is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. The literature on these patients reports that mobility, endurance, trunk strength and lifting capacity decrease during the process of chronicity. Chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons. Methods: Our study group consisted of 90 disabled CLBP patients (44 female, 46 male; average age 42 years) who underwent a multidisciplinary 8-week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support (instruction, endurance training, strength exercises, behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy). Initially these patients where compared with 107 asymptomatic persons (44 female, 63 male, average age 41 years). The patients were investigated before and after treatment, and at intervals of 6 and 12 months. The reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison. Physical assessment included a medical examination (mainly diagnosis of radicular or nonradicular pain), changes in the lumbar spine revealed by X-ray studies according to Herron and Turner, rating of physical impairment according to Waddell, flexibility, length of hamstrings muscles (SLR), test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the Swiss group of Spring and isokinetic measurements (LIDO Back), tests of lifting capacity (LIDO Lift), and (in part) of general endurance on a cycle ergometer (CASE 15 Marquette). Results: Physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced SLR (shortened hamstrings) and decreased spinal mobility. Patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals. The results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group. In principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines. Cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients. At the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly. In many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group. With time, however, training effects gradually decreased. The success of treatment (return to work, absence from work, pain reduction, use of medical care) was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment. Conclusion: Study results showed that physical capacity in disabled patients with low back pain is substantially reduced in comparison to persons who do not suffer from back pain. The only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance, in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group. However, even CLBP- patients with long-term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program. Back extensor muscle training has to be included in physical therapy. Because of loss of condition during the time after treatment, regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary. Overall, treatment of CLBP has to include physical training and psychosocial treatment to achieve satisfactory results.

AB  - Objectives: Short- and long-term effects of an interdisciplinary outpatient pain program (IOPP) in terms of quality of life, coping strategies, experiencing of pain and pain intensity as well as the influence of age, gender, or migration background. Design: Single, prospective cohort with assessments at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3, 6, 12 months follow-up. Patients: A total of 175 patients with chronic, nonmalignant pain syndromes (32.1% male and 67.9% female; age 43 Â± 9.6 years). Intervention. Multi-professional, biopsychosocial-oriented pain program for the duration of 8 weeks. Outcomes. Pain intensity, Pain Disability Index (German Version of Pain Disability Index, PDI-G), cognitive and behavioral coping strategies (Verarbeitung chronischer Schmerzen FESV), Marburger questionnaire about habitual subjective well-being, and processing of chronic pain (VerÃ¤nderungsfragebogen des Erlebens und Verhaltens, VEV). The migration background was considered to determine whether this variable influences the clinical outcomes. Results: All the mentioned variables except pain intensity improved significantly after the program (P < 0.05); whereas, after the 1-year follow-up, most of the parameters returned to the baseline values. Solely the subscale 'pain-related psychological strain' remained significantly better compared with baseline (P < 0.05). The variable 'migration background' influenced the outcomes PDI-G, habitual well-being, and FESV (P < 0.001; variance of 16.7% 95% confidence interval 7.8â€“25.5]). After 12 months, 49.4% showed an improvement with regard to the VEV outcome measurement, 22.6% showed no changes, and 28% showed worsening of the symptoms. Gender and age did not influence the results at 12 months (P = 0.408; P = 0.964). Conclusion: This study provides evidence for the short-term effect of the IOPP in chronic pain patients as well as the long-term effect for the variable 'painrelated psychological strain.'

AB  - This paper presents the results of a prospective observational cohort study investigating referral practices to six specialized pain centres (SPCs) in 303 patients with headache (HD), low back pain (LBP), and neuropathic pain (NP). The study was divided into three parts. Part 1: The pain health care history (contacts with general practitioners and specialists, further referrals, time spans, therapies) before first contact with the SPC. Part 2: Reality of pain therapy and management in the SPC (patients’ attrition, interdisciplinarity of therapy and novel therapeutic strategies instigated). Part 3: Follow-up and assessment of pain levels (NRS, SES), disability scores (PDI), QoL scores (SF 12), and anxiety and depression scores (HADS) at 0, 6 and 12 months. Using an ordinal linear regression model, factors predicting a good treatment outcome were identified. On average it took 3 years of pain symptoms before first consultation with GP. The median time period from the first pain sensations until the appointment in the SPC was 12 years. Nearly half of the referrals to specialists or SPCs were initiated by a non-professional. In the SPC the medication was changed in 71% of cases. Care was interdisciplinary in only 32%. At 6 and 12 months after the first contact with the SPC, only 20% of the patients had improved with respect to levels of pain and psychometric data. A high degree of chronicity, a history of pain-associated surgeries and low social support were negative predictors for treatment outcome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Data of a multimodal pain management program of the multidisciplinary pain management centre at the University Hospital of Dresden is presented. Over a period of 4 weeks, supplemented by an additional week 3 months later (booster week), patients with chronic pain of different origins are being treated in groups of 12. Based on the principles of the biopsychosocial pain model and the idea of functional restoration, the program is dedicated for pain patients where outpatient treatment was insufficient. Methods: The program was evaluated on the basis of pain intensity (NRS), pain disability (PDI), fear and depression (HADS-D), catastrophizing (CSQ) and health-related quality of life and vitality (SF-36). The data were collected at the beginning and end of the initial 4 week treatment period, at the end of the booster period as well as 6 and 12 months after the end of active treatment. Results: A total of 189 patients were included in the program in the period from January 2006 until August 2008. All outcome parameter showed statistically significant improvements with small to high effect sizes (ES 0.20-0.95). The results stayed stable even 1 year after the treatment. The highest effect sizes were found in catastrophizing (ES 0.86) and average pain intensity (ES 0.95). The primary pain diagnosis (e. g. low back pain versus headache) had no impact on treatment outcome. Conclusion: Significant and clinically relevant improvements could be achieved with the multimodal pain management program in groups of 12 patients. The results were stable over a time period of 1 year. Pain diagnosis had no impact on the outcome. © 2009 Springer Medizin Verlag.

AB  - This study evaluated whether patients with somatic symptom disorder, expressing chronic pain that could not be attributed to a medical condition, would benefit from an 8-week inpatient residence at a psychiatric ward. In the 1-year follow-up after termination the authors examined the extent to which the integrated treatment decreased patient costs. A total of 106 patients participated in the follow-up and reported a significant improvement in their general health (Cohen's d = 1.5-2.21), a decrease in impairment due to pain (d = 2.24), and a decrease in symptom severity (d = 1.29). They took fewer medications and sick days, reported fewer hospital stays and medical examinations, and consulted and changed physicians and outpatient clinics less often (d = 0.55-1.1). The average cost per patient was cut in half, down to 80,000/$96,000 per year. From a clinical standpoint, group analysis that focused on aggression was the most effective intervention.

AB  - Background: Improvement of the long-term effectiveness of multidisciplinary ortho-paedic rehabilitation (MOR) in the management of chronic non-specific low back pain (CLBP) remains a central issue for health care in Germany. We developed an interprofessional and interdisciplinary, biopsychosocial rehabilitation concept named "PASTOR" to promote self-management in adults with CLBP and compared its effectiveness with the current model of MOR. Methods: A multicentre quasi-experimental study with three measurement time points was implemented. 680 adults aged 18 to 65 with CLBP were assed for eligibil-ity in three inpatient rehabilitation centres in Germany. At first the effects of the MOR, with a total extent of 48 hours (control group), were assessed. Thereafter, PASTOR was implemented and evaluated in the same centres (intervention group). It consisted of six interprofessional modules, which were provided on 12 days in fixed groups, with a total extent of 48 hours. Participants were assessed with self-report measures at baseline, discharge, and 12 months for functional ability (primary outcome) using the Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire (FFbH-R) and vari-ous secondary outcomes (e.g. pain, health status, physical activity, pain coping, pain-related cognitions). Results: In total 536 participants were consecutively assigned to PASTOR (n=266) or MOR (n=270). At 12 months, complete data of 368 participants was available. The adjusted betweengroup difference in the FFbH-R at 12 months was 6.58 (95% CI 3.38 to 9.78) using complete data and 3.56 (95% CI 0.45 to 6.67) using available da-ta, corresponding to significant small-to-medium effect sizes of d=0.42 (p<0.001) and d=0.10 (p=0.025) in favour of PASTOR. Further improvements in secondary out-comes were also observed in favour of PASTOR. Conclusion: The interprofessional and interdisciplinary, biopsychosocial rehabilita-tion program PASTOR shows some improvements of the long-term effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation in the management of adults with CLBP. Further insights into mechanisms of action of complex intervention programs are required., Copyright:© 2015 Semrau et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes can improve physical functioning and help patients with long-term pain back to work. Little is known, however, of the extent to which such rehabilitation also affects life satisfaction, pain severity, and disability. We wanted to evaluate if a 5-week rehabilitation programme for patients with long-term pain improves life satisfaction and decreases pain severity and disability. METHODS: The subjects were 164 patients aged 18-65 years from a pain rehabilitation clinic. Most of them were referred from primary care units. One group of repeated tests was used. Participants were asked to fill out the LiSat-11 checklist and parts of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI), including pain severity, at admission, at discharge, and 1 year after the rehabilitation programme. RESULTS: Satisfaction with life as a whole, and six of ten LiSat-11 domains improved during the follow-up, though none reached the levels for the general population. MPI subscales pain severity, pain interference, life control, and affective distress improved, whereas no change was observed for general activity. Patients older than 38 years decreased more in MPI affective distress than younger patients. Gender, pain severity, and work status before the programme did not significantly influence the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that multidisciplinary rehabilitation improves life satisfaction, reduces pain severity, and reduces negative psychological, social, and behavioural effects of pain. These outcome variables relate to domains known to be of interest for patients and should therefore be considered for evaluation of rehabilitation programmes for long-term pain.

AB  - Background: The aim of this investigation was to analyze temporal changes in anxiety, depression, and stress in patients with musculoskeletal pain for a period of up to 2 years after a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program, in relation to sick-listing (registered with The Swedish Social Insurance Agency [Forsakringskassan] for sickness benefit). Methods: Ten persons with full-time sick leave (absence from work for medical reasons) (group 1) and 49 with part-time or no sick leave (group 2) at the end of the 2-year study period participated. It was shown in a previous study that group 1 had higher pain rating and higher subjective physical disability than group 2, with little or no improvement during and after rehabilitation. In the present study, all participants were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and a self-rated stress test. Results: Participants with full-time sick leave during the study period (group 1) showed improved stress levels but no change in anxiety and depression levels. Anxiety, depression, and stress changed more favorably in participants with part-time or no sick leave than in those with full-time sick leave. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that investigation and appropriate treatment of psychological symptoms, including anxiety and depression, are important in multidisciplinary rehabilitation of patients with musculoskeletal disorders. © 2012 Sjostrom et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - The current study evaluated a multidisciplinary pain management center. Thirty-eight patients with disabling chronic pain (mainly low back or head/neck/upper back pain) were interviewed before admission to the pain center and again during an 18-27 month follow-up to assess treatment outcome. Patients participating in the 3-week inpatient/outpatient program learned a variety of physiological and psychological methods of pain control. Results showed statistically significant reductions in (a) addictive medications, (b) subjective pain ratings, (c) the number of functional activities that cause pain, and (d) the number of visits to health-care professionals. The number of patients who returned to work and the implications of both time-loss compensation and the number of months since last employed are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that pain acceptance strategies related to psychological flexibility are important in the presence of chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, the predictors of these strategies have not been studied extensively in patients with Whiplash Associated Disorders (WAD). PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to predict chronic pain acceptance and engagement in activities at one-year follow-up with pain intensity, fear of movement, perceived responses from significant others, outcome expectancies, and demographic variables in patients with WAD before and after multimodal rehabilitation (MMR). STUDY DESIGN: The design of this investigation was a cohort study with one-year post-rehabilitation follow-up. STUDY SETTING: The subjects participated in MMR at a Swedish rehabilitation clinic during 2009-2015. PATIENT SAMPLE: The patients had experienced a whiplash trauma (WAD grade I-II) and were suffering from pain and reduced functionality. A total of 386 participants were included: 297 fulfilled the post-rehabilitation measures, and 177 were followed up at one year after MMR. Outcome measures were all self-reports: Demographic variables, pain intensity, fear of movement, perceived responses from significant others, and outcome expectations were measured at the start and after MMR. Chronic pain acceptance and engagement in activities were measured at follow-up. METHODS: The data were obtained from a Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation, SQRPR. This study received no funding (0 USD). There are no conflicts of interest for any of the authors. RESULTS: Outcome expectancies of recovery, supporting and distracting responses of significant others and fear of (re)injury and movement before MMR were significant predictors of engagement in activities at follow-up. Pain intensity and fear of (re)injury and movement after MMR significantly predicted engagement in activities at follow-up. Supporting responses of significant others and fear of (re)injury and movement before MMR were significant predictors of pain acceptance at the one-year follow-up. Solicitous responses of significant others and fear of (re)injury and movement at post-rehabilitation significantly predicted pain acceptance at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: For engagement in activities and pain acceptance, the fear of movement appears to emerge as the strongest predictor, but patients' perceived reactions from their spouses need to be considered in planning the management of WAD.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine (a) whether a cognitive-behavioral treatment (differentially) affects pain coping and cognition; and (b) whether changes in pain coping and cognition during treatment mediate treatment outcome. Participants in this randomized clinical trial were 148 patients with chronic low back pain attending a multidisciplinary treatment program consisting of operant-behavioral treatment plus cognitive coping skills training (N = 59) or group discussion (N = 58) or allocated to a waiting list control condition (N = 31). Patients improved with respect to level of depression, pain behavior and activity tolerance at posttreatment and 12-month follow-up. Treatment also resulted in a short- and long-term decrease in catastrophizing and an enhancement of internal pain control. Changes in catastrophizing and to a lesser degree in internal pain control mediated the reduction in level of depression and pain behavior following treatment. The use of behavioral and cognitive interventions aimed at decreasing catastrophizing thoughts about the consequences of pain and promoting internal expectations of pain control possibly constitute an important avenue of change irrespective of the type of treatment. © 2003 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.

AB  - Background: In recent years, multidisciplinary rehabilitation (MDR) became an alternative treatment option for chronic non-cancer pain. MDR is mostly available in specialized pain units, usually at rehabilitation centers where the level of knowledge and therapeutically options to treat pain conditions are considered to be high. There is strong evidence that MDR in specialized pain units is affecting pain and improves the quality of life in a sustainable manner. There are few studies about MDR outcome in primary health care, especially in those units situated in rural areas and with a different population than that encountered in specialized hospitals. That, in spite of the fact that the prevalence of pain in the patients treated in primary care practice is about 30%. The aim of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of MDR for chronic non-cancer patients in a primary health care unit. Methods: This study included a total of 51 patients with chronic pain conditions who were admitted and completed the local MDR-program at the primary health care unit in Arvika, Sweden. The major complaint categories were fibromyalgia (53%), pain from neck and shoulder (28%) or low back pain (12%). The inclusion criteria were age between 16 and 67 years and chronic non-cancer pain with at least 3 months duration. The multidisciplinary team consisted of a general practitioner, two physiotherapists, two psychologists and one occupational therapist. The 6-week treatment took place in group sessions with 6-8 members each and included cognitive-behavioral treatment, education on pain physiology, ergonomics, physical exercises and relaxation techniques.Primary outcomes included pain intensity, pain severity, anxiety and depression scores, social and physical activity, and secondary outcomes were sick leave, opioid consumption and health care utilization assessed in the beginning of the treatment and at one year follow-up. Data was taken from the Swedish Quality Register for Pain Rehabilitation (SQRP) and the patients' medical journal. Results: One year after MDR treatment, sick leave decreased from 75.6% to 61.5% (p< 0.05). Utilization of health-care during one year decreased significantly from 27.4 to 20.1 contacts (p= 0.02). There were significant improvements concerning social activity (p= 0.03) and depression (p< 0.05), but not in anxiety (p= 0.1) and physical activity (p= 0.08). Although not statistically significant, some numerical decrease in the mean levels of pain intensity, pain severity and opioid consumption were reported one year after MDR (p> 0.05). Conclusions: The results obtained one year after rehabilitation indicated that patients with chronic non-cancer pain might benefit from MDR in primary health care settings. Implications: This study suggests that MDR in primary care settings as well as MDR at specialized pain units may lead to better coping in chronic non-cancer pain conditions with lower depression scores and higher social activity, leading to lower sick leave. This study demonstrated that there is a place for MDR in primary health care units with the given advantage of local intervention in rural areas allowing the patients to achieve rehabilitation in their home environment. © 2013 Scandinavian Association for the Study of Pain.

AB  - Objective: To test the outcome of active multidisciplinary treatment in an outpatient setting upon sick-leave status among patients with neck, shoulder and low back pain. Design: Multidisciplinary treatment was administered to 121 patients (intervention group) over 4 weeks of structured intervention, followed by 8 weeks of less structured consultations. Effects of treatment were compared with usual treatment (control group: n = 97). Patients: All patients were in the chronic stage of pain (average sick-leave: 6 months) with different diagnoses: neck-shoulder pain, low back pain or low back pain with radiating extremity pain. Method: The intervention group programme included posture corrections, pain perception, skills to cope with pain, aerobic and fitness-promoting activities and relaxation techniques administered to groups of 8-10 patients. The Local National Insurance Office referred the patients who were diagnosed by general practitioners. A 12-month follow-up by the Local National Insurance Office provided feedback about sick-leave status of all 218 patients. Results: There was a significant treatment difference in proportion taken off the sick list after 12 months (intervention group: 78.5%; control group: 50.5%; p < 0.001). The difference was greater among low back pain (p < 0.001) than among neck-shoulder (p < 0.053) and low back pain with radiating extremity pain (p < 0.031) patients. Conclusion: Long-term effects of active multidisciplinary treatment were superior to treatment as usual in all diagnostic group. Â© 2004 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Objective: To test the outcome of active multidisciplinary treatment in an outpatient setting upon sick-leave status among patients with neck, shoulder and low back pain. Design: Multidisciplinary treatment was administered to 121 patients (intervention group) over 4 weeks of structured intervention, followed by 8 weeks of less structured consultations. Effects of treatment were compared with usual treatment (control group: n = 97). Patients: All patients were in the chronic stage of pain (average sick-leave: 6 months) with different diagnoses: neck-shoulder pain, low back pain or low back pain with radiating extremity pain. Method: The intervention group programme included posture corrections, pain perception, skills to cope with pain, aerobic and fitness-promoting activities and relaxation techniques administered to groups of 8-10 patients. The Local National Insurance Office referred the patients who were diagnosed by general practitioners. A 12-month follow-up by the Local National Insurance Office provided feedback about sick-leave status of all 218 patients. Results: There was a significant treatment difference in proportion taken off the sick list after 12 months (intervention group: 78.5%; control group: 50.5%; p < 0.001). The difference was greater among low back pain (p < 0.001) than among neck-shoulder (p < 0.053) and low back pain with radiating extremity pain (p < 0.031) patients. Conclusion: Long-term effects of active multidisciplinary treatment were superior to treatment as usual in all diagnostic group. Â© 2004 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Conducted a 2-yr follow-up study on 21 patients (mean age 45 yrs) who participated in a structured pain management program that taught cognitive-behavioral strategies for coping with chronic pain, including relaxation training, social skills training, and cognitive restructuring. Both treatment (TR) and waiting list/control (WL) groups were assessed before the study (Time 1) and later (Time 2). 10 TR Ss were assessed at 4 mo, and 9 were assessed at 2 yrs. After Time 2 assessment, all WL Ss were offered the program. Results of scores on a sickness impact measure (M. Bergner et al, 1976) show that significant decreases in physical and psychosocial dysfunction achieved at posttreatment were maintained at 2-yr follow-up. Scores on the Profile of Mood States also demonstrate maintenance of significantly decreased negative mood states. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term efficacy of a 3-week intensive residential multidisciplinary non-pharmacological treatment program (including individually prescribed and monitored aerobic exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy) on fibromyalgia symptoms and aerobic fitness. METHODS: Twenty-five women with fibromyalgia participated in six experimental sessions (pre-admission, immediately before and immediately after the treatment, and to 2, 5 and 12 months afterwards) in which they underwent clinical, psychophysical and psychological examinations: pain intensity (VAS), pain area (percentage of total body surface), deep pressure pain threshold at 18 tender point sites measured with a pressure algometer, an incremental step test with blood lactate determination and calculation of the individual intensity of exercise corresponding to 2 mM of lactate concentration (W2, index of aerobic fitness). Depression and coping were evaluated with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Brief Pain Coping Inventory (BPCI), respectively. RESULTS: Pain intensity, pain area and number of positive tender points were significantly reduced up to 12 months, while deep pressure pain threshold and W2 increased. CES-D score decreased until two months. Among the 18 items of the BCPI, only item 3 ("physical exercise/stretching") changed significantly, increasing until 12 months. CONCLUSION: In fibromyalgia patients, whose symptoms before treatment were constant, a 3-week intensive residential multidisciplinary treatment program showed one-year efficacy in improving pain and aerobic fitness. The acquisition of physical exercise as a coping strategy for chronic pain acceptance could explain the long-term effects of our brief treatment.

AB  - Previous observations stress the importance of patient characteristics as contributors to treatment outcome. In this study the outcome of integrative pain group therapy was investigated in relation to prior treatment psychosocial characteristics in pain clinic outpatients with chronic pain. The patients participated in 10 weekly sessions (2 1/2 hours) of integrative pain group therapy consisting of cognitive-behavioural strategies and light physical exercises. After the 12-month follow-up the modified method of cluster analysis was applied on the admittance data of the sample of 47 patients in order to divide the subjects into three homogenized subgroups (Interpersonally Distressed patients, Adaptive Copers and Dysfunctional patients) with varying prior treatment characteristics. The outcome of treatment was analysed by comparing the effect of intervention on the psychosocial functional profiles of the subgroups. The functional profiles were assessed by a six-scale self-report questionnaire describing the psychosocial components of three functional dimensions as recommended by the World Health Organization (1999). The results supported the previous conclusions that prior treatment functional profiles are important contributors to pain treatment outcome. However, the results also suggested that cluster analysis technique may be a very robust method to divide patients into 'homogenized' subgroups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the effects of a multidisciplinary treatment program on health-related quality of life of Iranian patients living with chronic low back, at 12 months follow-up. METHODS: This study is an extended follow-up of an original randomized, controlled trial with registration number NCT00600197. In the present study 87 patients in an intervention group and 91 patients in a control group were assessed at 12 months follow-up. The intervention was a group-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation program which continued by monthly motivational consultation by telephone from 6 to 12 months after intervention. Data from three standard measures, Short Form 36 (SF-36), QDS and RDQ were collected at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up and analyzed through repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Despite the similarity between the two groups who completed the 6 month follow-up in terms of all baseline variables, there were significant differences between the two groups in all domains of the SF-36 scale, as well as QDS and RDQ scales (P < 0.05). Also, there were differences within each group over time in the SF-36 domains and disability measurements (P < 0.05). The physical function mean score differed significantly when the interaction between groups and time points was examined (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the multidisciplinary program could improve the domains of health related quality of life and disability in chronic low back pain patients up to 12 months.

AB  - Objective: Traditional analytic approaches may oversimplify the mechanisms by which interventions effect change. Transition probability models can quantify both symptom improvement and sustained reduction in symptoms. We sought to quantify transition probabilities between higher and lower states for four outcome variables and to compare two treatment arms with respect to these transitions. Method: Secondary analysis of a year-long collaborative care intervention for chronic musculoskeletal pain in veterans. Forty-two clinicians were randomized to intervention or treatment as usual (TAU), with 401 patients nested within clinician. The outcome variables, pain intensity, pain interference, depression and disability scores were dichotomized (lower/higher). Probabilities of symptom improvement (transitioning from higher to lower) or sustained reduction (remaining lower) were compared between intervention and TAU groups at 0- to 3-, 3- to 6- and 6- to 12-month intervals. General estimating equations quantified the effect of the intervention on transitions. Results: In adjusted models, the intervention group showed about 1.5 times greater odds of both symptom improvement and sustained reduction compared to TAU, for all the outcomes except disability. Conclusions: Despite no formal relapse prevention program, intervention patients were more likely than TAU patients to experience continued relief from depression and pain. Collaborative care interventions may provide benefits beyond just symptom reduction. Copyright © 2014 .

AB  - Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of operant pain treatment for fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) in an inpatient setting. Methods. Sixty-one patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for FMS were randomly assigned to the operant pain treatment group (OTG) or a standardized medical program with an emphasis on physical therapy (PTG). Pain assessments were performed before, immediately after, 6 months after, and 15 months after treatment. Results. The 41 OTG patients reported a significant and stable reduction in pain intensity, interference, solicitous behavior of the spouse, medication, pain behaviors, number of doctor visits, and days at a hospital as well as an increase in sleeping time. Sixty-five percent of the OTG compared with none of the 21 patients in the PTG showed clinically significant improvement. Conclusion. These results suggest that operant pain treatment provided in an inpatient setting is an effective treatment for FMS, whereas a purely somatically oriented program may lead to a deterioration of the pain problem.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate prognostic factors for physical and emotional functioning following interdisciplinary multimodal pain rehabilitation, by targeting patients' baseline characteristics and health measures. METHOD(S): A prospective cohort of 2,876 patients from 38 specialist clinics across Sweden, who were completing interdisciplinary multimodal pain rehabilitation programmes, was followed through the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation, from initial assessment to 12-month follow-up. Using logistic regression, baseline data were regressed to predict improvement in Physical functioning and Emotional functioning, fused by principal component analyses using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULT(S): Employment status emerged as having the largest effect sizes in both Physical functioning and Emotional functioning; Working: odds ratio (OR) 2.05 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.64-2.56) and OR 1.59 (95% CI 1.27-1.98), respectively. Strong beliefs in restored health, better initial emotional health, lower levels of pain and pain interference, and younger age all predicted Physical functioning. European origin, higher levels of general activity, and sense of life control all predicted Emotional functioning. Worse initial physical and emotional health predicted the corresponding dependent outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): Employment was consistently found to be an important prognostic factor, suggesting the significance of avoiding delay in interdisciplinary multimodal pain rehabilitation. A positive treatment expectancy was of importance. In general, multidimensional measures indicated that better initial status was more favourable; however, inconsistency implies a complex prognostic picture.

AB  - The effects of outpatient group behavioral therapy including aerobic exercise (BE), behavioral therapy only (B), and aerobic exercise only (E) on pain and physical and psychosocial disability were evaluated and compared in a group of mildy disabled chronic low-back-pain patients. Ninety-six Ss were randomly assigned to the 3 treatments and a waiting-list control (WL) condition and assessed on a variety of patient self-report, spouse-rated, and direct observational measures at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Patients in the BE condition, but not the B or E conditions, improved significantly more pretreatment to posttreatment than did WL patients on the patient self-report and observer-rated measures. At both follow-ups, all 3 treatment groups remained significantly improved from pretreatment, with no significant differences among treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of 2 models of chronic pain management. DESIGN: Randomized comparative trial with 2 active treatment arms. SETTING: Outpatient pain management clinics. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 113 adults with chronic pain of 0.5 to 38 years duration in (mean, 8.8y). INTERVENTIONS: Cognitive behavioral therapy (including education, relaxation, use of cognitive coping strategies, pacing, exercise) delivered in group-based multidisciplinary program or in an individual therapy program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-report of interference with daily activities and sense of control over pain (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory [WHYMPI]) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory). Secondary outcome measures were state anxiety (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety conventory), analgesic medication consumption, general activity, and pain severity (WHYMPI). Measurement points were 0 (before treatment), 2 months (end of treatment), and 3, 6 and 12 months (follow-up). RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the 2 modes of treatment at any of the major time points (0, 2, 12mo). Both treatment conditions made significant and sustained improvements on all primary outcome measures, although sense of control over pain tended to decline by 1 year. Individually treated participants made slower gains in some areas, but showed a lesser tendency to rebound at the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: The 2 programs appear to be equally efficacious for pain management in adults with chronic pain. In practical terms, the choice of model for service provision may rest more on local issues such as the availability of space and staff time.

AB  - An inpatient chronic pain management unit stressing a multidimensional behavioral approach has been in operation since April 1979 at a 405-bed community hospital. Components of the program include chemical detoxification, physical, occupational, and relaxation therapies, group meetings, and family therapy. The first 13 patients to complete the program achieved 100 percent success in medication reduction and experienced decreases in depression, hysteria, hypochondriasis, and self-ratings of pain intensity. Many have returned to work. Follow-up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months shows maintenance of improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of methodological flaws and a lack of theoretical foundation of body awareness (BA) in previous effect studies of interventions directed to stimulate BA, it is impossible to attribute treatment effects to this specific component of a multidisciplinary treatment. Therefore, this study evaluated short-term and long-term effects of a multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation program with and without psychomotor therapy (PMT), which focused on BA (measured by the scale of body connection) as a primary target of intervention. METHODS: Ninety-four patients clustered in 20 treatment groups were cluster randomized, using a biased-coin design, to multidisciplinary treatment as usual with or without PMT. Outcome variables were health-related quality of life, disability, and depression. BA, catastrophizing, and self-efficacy were measured as potential process variables. Assessments were performed at baseline, directly after treatment, and at 3, 6, and 12 month follow-ups. The data were analyzed by linear mixed-model analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Data of all 94 patients were used for analyses. After treatment, significant differences favoring PMT were found between conditions on depression (regression coefficient [RC]=-5.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.81 to -1.21), BA (RC=0.23; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.42) and catastrophizing (RC=-4.76; 95% CI, -8.03 to -1.48). These differences were no longer significant for depression at the 3-month follow-up and for catastrophizing at the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: No clinical meaningful differences were found between treatment conditions in the primary outcome measures health-related quality of life and disability. However, this is the first long-term RCT that has shown that PMT improves BA in patients with chronic pain and shows good effect size and a significant decrease for catastrophizing.

AB  - Objective: Patients with chronic pain and severe disuse syndrome have pain with physiological, psychological and social adaptations. The duration and severity of complaints, combined with previously failed treatments, makes them unsuitable for treatment in primary care. Design: A prospective waiting list controlled study. Patients: A total of 32 patients with chronic pain for at least one year and severe disuse syndrome were included in an inpatient multidisciplinary cognitive behavioural treatment. Methods: Patients were assessed before the waiting list period, before the clinical phase, after the clinical phase and after follow-ups of 6 months and one year. The visual analogue scale for pain and fatigue were assessed. Muscle strength of the arms and legs, arm endurance and a 6-minute walking test were used to assess physical outcome. The Symptom Checklist-90, RAND-36, pain cognition list and the Tampa scale for kinesiophobia were used to assess psychological outcome. Results: Long-term significant (p<0.001) improvements were found for pain, fatigue, walking distance, muscle strength, anxiety, depression, somatization, negative self-efficacy, and catastrophizing in the intervention period. Conclusion: An inpatient multidisciplinary cognitive behavioural programme is beneficial for patients with chronic pain and a severe disuse syndrome. © 2009 Foundation of Rehabilitation Information.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary pain management (MPM) is a generally-accepted method for treating chronic pain, but heterogeneous outcome measures provide only limited conclusions concerning its effectiveness. Therefore, further studies on the effectiveness of MPM are needed to identify subgroups of patients who benefit, or do not benefit, from these interventions. Our aim was to analyze health-related quality of life (HRQoL) changes after MPM and to identify factors associated with treatment outcomes. METHOD(S): We carried out a real-world observational follow-up study of chronic pain patients referred to a tertiary multidisciplinary outpatient pain clinic to describe, using the validated HRQoL instrument 15D, the HRQoL change after MPM, and to identify factors associated with this change. 1043 patients responded to the 15D HRQoL questionnaire at baseline and 12 months after the start of treatment. Background data were collected from the pre-admission questionnaire of the pain clinic. RESULT(S): 53% of the patients reported a clinically important improvement and, of these, 81% had a major improvement. 35% reported a clinically important deterioration, and 12% had no change in HRQoL. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that major improvement was positively associated with shorter duration of pain (<3 years), worse baseline HRQoL, higher education levels, and being employed. CONCLUSION(S): The majority of the patients reported significant HRQoL improvement after multidisciplinary pain management. Better understanding of the factors associated with treatment outcomes is needed to meet the needs of those who had unfavourable outcomes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the course of and predictors for disability in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNSLBP). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the course of disability and identify clinically important prognostic factors of low-back-pain-specific disability in patients with CNSLBP receiving multidisciplinary therapy. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was conducted. METHODS: A total of 1,760 patients with CNSLBP who received multidisciplinary therapy were evaluated for their course of disability and prognostic factors at baseline and at 2-, 5-, and 12-month follow-ups. Recovery was defined as 30% reduction in low back pain-specific disability at follow-up compared with baseline and as absolute recovery if the score on the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (QBPDS) was </=20 points at follow-up. Potential prognostic factors were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Mean patient-reported disability scores on the QBPDS ranged from 51.7 (SD=15.6) at baseline to 31.7 (SD=15.2), 31.1 (SD=18.2), and 29.1 (SD=20.0) at 2, 5, and 12 months, respectively. The prognostic factors identified for recovery at 5 and 12 months were younger age and high scores on disability and on the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (Physical and Mental Component Summaries) at baseline. In addition, at 5-month follow-up, a shorter duration of complaints was a positive predictor, and having no comorbidity and less pain at baseline were additional predictors at 12-month follow-up. LIMITATIONS: Missing values at 5- and 12-month follow-ups were 11.1% and 45.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: After multidisciplinary treatment, the course of disability in patients with CNSLBP continued to decline over a 12-month period. At 5- and 12-month follow-ups, prognostic factors were identified for a clinically relevant decrease in disability scores on the QBPDS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been increasing focus on factors predicting the development of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. For patients already experiencing chronic non-specific low back pain it is also relevant to investigate which prognostic factors predict recovery. We present the design of a cohort study that aims to determine the course and prognostic factors for recovery in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. METHODS/DESIGN: All participating patients were recruited (Jan 2003-Dec 2008) from the same rehabilitation centre and were evaluated by means of (postal) questionnaires and physical examinations at baseline, during the 2-month therapy program, and at 5 and 12 months after start of therapy. The therapy protocol at the rehabilitation centre used a bio-psychosocial approach to stimulate patients to adopt adequate (movement) behaviour aimed at physical and functional recovery. The program is part of regular care and consists of 16 sessions of 3 hours each, over an 8-week period (in total 48 hours), followed by a 3-month self-management program. The primary outcomes are low back pain intensity, disability, quality of life, patient's global perceived effect of recovery, and participation in work. Baseline characteristics include information on socio-demographics, low back pain, employment status, and additional clinical items status such as fatigue, duration of activities, and fear of kinesiophobia. Prognostic variables are determined for recovery at short-term (5 months) and long-term (12 months) follow-up after start of therapy. DISCUSSION: In a routine clinical setting it is important to provide patients suffering from chronic non-specific low back pain with adequate information about the prognosis of their complaint.

AB  - Background: Non-specific chronic low back pain disorders have been proven resistant to change, and there is still a lack of clear evidence for one specific treatment intervention being superior to another. Methods: This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the efficacy of a behavioural approach to management, classification-based cognitive functional therapy, compared with traditional manual therapy and exercise. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the group differences in treatment effects. Primary outcomes at 12-month follow-up were Oswestry Disability Index and pain intensity, measured with numeric rating scale. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age between 18 and 65 years, diagnosed with non-specific chronic low back pain for >3 months, localized pain from T12 to gluteal folds, provoked with postures, movement and activities. Oswestry Disability Index had to be >14% and pain intensity last 14 days >2/10. A total of 121 patients were randomized to either classification-based cognitive functional therapy group n = 62) or manual therapy and exercise group (n > = 59). Results: The classification-based cognitive functional therapy group displayed significantly superior outcomes to the manual therapy and exercise group, both statistically (p < 0.001) and clinically. For Oswestry Disability Index, the classification-based cognitive functional therapy group improved by 13.7 points, and the manual therapy and exercise group by 5.5 points. For pain intensity, the classification-based cognitive functional therapy improved by 3.2 points, and the manual therapy and exercise group by 1.5 points. Conclusions: The classification-based cognitive functional therapy produced superior outcomes for non-specific chronic low back pain compared with traditional manual therapy and exercise. © 2012 European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain Chapters.

AB  - 71 patients (mean age 42.2 yrs) with chronic low back pain were assigned to a waiting-list (WL) or to 1 of 3 behavioral rehabilitation treatments: (1) operant (OP); (2) operant–cognitive (OC), aimed at reinterpretation of catastrophizing pain cognitions (PCs) and at enhancing self-control (SCL); or (3) operant–respondent (OR). The 56 patients for whom data were available at 6 mo and at 1 yr generally improved on measures of pain behaviors (PBs), health behaviors (HBs), PCs, and affective distress, with treatment groups improving significantly more than WL Ss. OC and OR conditions were more efficacious in decreasing PBs and increasing HBs and efficacy expectations than was the OP treatment alone. OC and OR Ss catastrophized less than did OP Ss, and OC Ss had better outcome efficacy than did OR Ss. Results suggest that effects of an OP treatment are magnified when SCL techniques are added.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) has been reported but its outcomes in the longer term and in mixed groups of chronic pain patients are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to describe the two-year outcomes of a 15-week multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation programme in patients with mixed CMP in terms of pain, activities, participation and healthcare usage. METHODS: Data were recorded routinely at admission, discharge, and at three, 12 and 24 months' follow-up for all consecutive patients with CMP referred to a rehabilitation programme over a 21-month period. The 15-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme consisted of cognitive behavioural therapy and exercise, as well as individual and group sessions with additional treatment modalities. Assessments included the Pain Disability Index (PDI), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) and numerical scales for pain and fatigue. Moreover, the RAND-36-Item Health Survey ('RAND-36') and questions on healthcare usage and work status were administered at admission, and at 12 and/or 24 months. Paired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, McNemar tests and mixed-model analyses were used to analyse changes over time. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients were included initially [mean age 44.1 (standard deviation 12.9) years], 143 of whom (87%) were women, with data from 125 (76%) and 120 (73%) patients being available at 12 and 24 months' follow-up, respectively. All outcomes showed statistically significant improvements between admission and discharge, and at three, 12 and 24 months' follow-up (p < 0.05). At 24 months, the median number of different healthcare providers visited in the previous year had decreased significantly compared with that at admission [from a median of 4 (range 1-13) to a median of 2 (range 0-9)], and within the group of patients working at admission (50%), the proportion of those working 25 hours or more per week had increased significantly from 16% to 48%. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in pain and functioning seen directly after a 15-week multidisciplinary treatment programme for patients with CMP were maintained, health care usage decreased and the number of working hours among working patients increased at 24 months' follow-up. Future studies are needed to examine if additional interventions after discharge can enhance further the favourable results. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Multidisciplinary team interventions aiming at breaking the vicious circle of impaired functioning are effective for clients with chronic pain. However, because of the growing number of people with such complaints, these interventions cannot be provided totally on a face-to-face basis. Therefore, the possibilities of intervention in the client's daily environment professionally supervised through distance learning, i.e., telemedicine, need to be considered.

AB  - Chronic neck pain is a common complaint in the Netherlands with a point prevalence of 14.3%. Patients with chronic neck pain are often referred to physiotherapy and, nowadays, are mostly treated with exercise therapy. It is, however, unclear which type of exercise therapy is to be preferred. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of behaviour graded activity (BGA) compared with conventional exercise (CE) for patients with chronic neck pain. Eligible patients with non-specific chronic neck were randomly allocated to either BGA or CE. Primary treatment outcome is the patient’s global perceived effect concerning recovery from complaint and daily functioning. Outcome assessment was performed at baseline, and at 4, 9, 26, and 52 weeks after randomization. Effectiveness was examined with general estimating equations analyses.Baseline demographics and patient characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. Mean age was 45.7 (SD 12.4) years and the median duration of complaints was 60 months. The mean number of treatments was 6.6 (SD 3.0) in BGA and 11.2 (SD 4.1) in CE. No significant differences between treatments were found in their effectiveness of managing patients with chronic neck pain. In both BGA and CE some patients reported recovery from complaints and daily function but the proportion of recovered patients did not exceed 50% during the 12-month follow-up period. Both groups showed clinically relevant improvements in physical secondary outcomes. International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN88733332.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to re-evaluate clients of a chronic pain center treatment program at least one year following their completion of the program to determine whether they had maintained improvements and to compare them to a group of clients who underwent the initial assessment but did not attend the treatment program.Methods The Chronic Pain Center, located in a mid-size Canadian city, offers an interdisciplinary treatment program. They had documented statistically significant improvement on several measures at the completion of the program but had no formal evaluation of longer-term effects. All clients assessed between 2004 and 2007 were invited to complete an evaluation by mail-out questionnaires, resulting in 142 participants treatment group = 88, comparison group = 54].Results The treatment group demonstrated significant improvement from assessment to discharge on all outcome measures. These improvements declined over time but remained significantly improved from the admission scores Wilks' LAMBDA = 0.501, F(1,48) = 4.788, P = 0.001]. However, no significant differences between the treatment and the comparison groups were found on any of the outcome measures at follow-up Wilks' LAMBDA = 0.930, F(1,107) = 1.014, P = 0.430].Conclusions Statistically significant improvement of treatment participants, over a short time period, which was maintained over time, strengthens the inference that the treatment program had a positive impact. Study limitations, including recruitment method and the use of a non-randomized comparison group, may have affected the ability to demonstrate a difference between the treatment and the comparison groups. Statistically significant improvements, however, need to be studied in more depth to determine how they relate to clinical significance. Â© 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To report the results of health economic analyses comparing two treatment approaches for chronic low back pain (CLBP). Design(s): Observational prospective cohort study comparing effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CLBP care provided at an integrative care clinic with that provided in other clinics within the same hospital. CLBP-related medical utilization, function, quality of life, and days of work incapacity were self-reported at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Settings/Location: Osher Clinical Center (OCC) based at a tertiary academic hospital (Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH]) and other clinics at BWH. Subjects: CLBP patients seeking care at OCC or non-OCC BWH clinics. Intervention(s): Integrative or conventional care for CLBP as prescribed by the treating clinician(s). Outcome measures: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated per treatment approach based on the SF-12. Cost per QALY gained was evaluated using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). ICERs based on CLBP-specific effectiveness measures (Roland Disability Questionnaire [RDQ] and bothersomeness of pain [BOP]) were exploratory outcomes. Result(s): Total adjusted annual CLBP-related costs per patient were greater in the OCC versus non-OCC group ($11,526.73 vs. $6,810.63). Between group differences in QALYs were small and ICER estimate of cost per QALY gained was high ($436,676). However, unadjusted mean direct costs per patient decreased over time in the OCC group. Savings in direct costs of $391 (95% confidence interval: -1,078 to 1,861) were observed in the OCC group for the 6- to 12-month period, driven primarily by reduced medication usage. ICERs based on adjusted RDQ and BOP group differences showed cost of $2,073 and $4,203 for a one-point reduction per respective scale. Conclusion(s): When adjusted for baseline differences, self-reported costs were higher in the OCC group with only small effects on QALYs. However, trends toward decreased direct expenditures and medication usage over time warrant further investigation. Future studies evaluating potential benefits of integrative care models for the management of CLBP should employ randomized designs, longer observational periods, and explore multiple metrics of cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Purpose: The high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain generates significant costs for primary health care and the whole of society. The development of appropriate interventions is therefore necessary. The aim of this effectiveness study was to assess the long-term effects of a primary health care multidisciplinary rehabilitation program in Sweden. Methods: An experimental group comprising 89 patients from two primary health care units received individualised treatment interventions after a multidisciplinary investigation. A control group of 69 patients with the same inclusion criteria from four other primary health care units were treated according to routine. All participants completed questionnaires measuring pain, sick leave, quality of life, health care utilisation, drug consumption and psychosocial factors at baseline and at 3-year follow-up. Results: After 3 years, utilisation of primary health care was significantly lower in the experimental group and work capacity was slightly but not significantly higher. The control group showed a trend of having a higher risk of high consumption after 3 years compared to the intervention group. There was no significant difference between the two groups concerning remaining variables such as function, catastrophising and pain. Conclusion: Both groups demonstrated considerable improvement over the course of 3 years. The experimental group had lower health care utilisation and a reduced risk of using large amounts of medication at the 3-year follow-up, indicating that compared with participants in the control group they were coping in a better way with pain.

AB  - Background. Chronic musculoskeletal pain of diffuse origin affects many, and at a significant cost. Evidence-based guidelines for therapeutic interventions are presented and exemplified. Material and methods. 200 patients with chronic myofascial pain and/or fibromyalgia who participated in a 4-week multidimensional rehabilitation programme, were included in the study. The programme included education and pain management in a cognitive setting, various forms of aerobic exercises, myofascial pain treatment, relaxation and medication as needed. The patients filled in questionnaires on arrival, at follow-up after six and 12-months and at discharge. They completed visual analogue scales (pain, fatigue, sleep problems, depression), the Nottingham Health Profile, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, global subjective improvement, and during the follow-up period also the physical activity level, changes in quality of life and occupational workload. Work capacity, a tender point count and whether patients met the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia were assessed at baseline and at discharge. Results. Significant improvements were seen in all variables throughout the follow-up period. 30 % of the fibromyalgia patients no longer met the diagnostic criteria at discharge. There was a significant increase in quality of life over time. After one year, more patients had returned to work and fewer were off sick, but there was also an increased number on disability pensions. The majority did exercise training on a regular basis. Interpretation. Our findings confirm the existing evidence-based guidelines by showing that multidimensional rehabilitation is an effective intervention for patients with widespread chronic pain. It is a challenge for health politicians to change today's common practice towards that described in evidence-based guidelines.

AB  - Assessed in a randomized controlled trial the relative merits of inpatient (IN) and outpatient (OT) cognitive behavioral approaches to pain management in 121 mixed chronic pain patients (mean age 50 yrs). Predictors of treatment outcome (PTOs) were also explored. Ss were randomly assigned to a 4-wk IN program or to an 8 half-day-per-wk OT program, or to a waiting list control group (WLCG). The WLCG was assessed at pretreatment, and at 1 mo postdischarge, and the IN and OT group also at 6 mo and 1 yr postdischarge; assessments included physical, functional and psychological measures, and medication use. Results showed no change in the WLCG; INs and OTs, comparable before treatment, both made significant improvements in physical performance and psychological function, and reduced medication use. INs made greater gains, and maintained them better at 1 yr; they also used less health care than OTs. There were no outstanding PTOs other than treatment group.

AB  - 55 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain who had been on sick leave for at least six months took part in a four week outpatient treatment programme. The programme was multidisciplinary and consisted of a combination of physical activity, formal lectures about health matters and individual consultations with doctor, psychologist, social worker, nurse and sports instructor. Pretreatment Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and Health Locus of Control showed the patients to have a typical chronic pain profile. The tests did not discriminate between those who had a favourable outcome and those who did not. At one year follow-up, 21 of the 55 patients had returned to work despite unchanged subjective intensity of pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of back school integrated with core-strengthening exercises on back-specific disability and pain-coping strategies and to examine how reactions to pain affect the outcomes of back school in patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN: A single-center prospective trial was conducted with 142 participants with chronic low-back pain (38 men and 104 women) who completed a back school program at the spine center of a university hospital. The subjects participated in a 4-wk program integrated with core-strengthening exercises. Back-specific disabilities were measured as a primary outcome before and after the program. Secondary outcomes were pain, Chronic Pain Coping Inventory, general health status assessed by the SF-36, and quantitative functional evaluations of factors, such as trunk muscle strength, endurance, and the back performance scale. A subgroup of 28 subjects (12 men and 16 women) of the total sample of 142 subjects was used to analyze the longitudinal association between coping strategies and the primary outcome in a long-term follow-up study. These participants were divided into three groups (much improved, slightly improved, and unimproved) based on changes in back-specific disability scores. RESULTS: Participants improved significantly in terms of back-specific disability, pain, general health, and quantitative functional tests according to the short-term evaluation. They used more relaxation and exercise/stretching techniques as coping strategies. Of the groups participating in the longer-term follow-up (T3), the much-improved group showed significant improvement between T1 (before back school) and T2 (after back school) in scores for relaxation (1.6 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.6 +/- 1.1), task persistence (2.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.7 +/- 1.2), and exercise (3.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.2 +/- 1.9), but the coping strategies of those in the slightly improved and unimproved groups did not change significantly at T2. CONCLUSIONS: Our back school program may help patients with chronic low back pain reduce back-specific disability and pain and develop wellness-focused coping strategies such as exercise and stretching.

AB  - Background: The day clinic for pain therapy at the Orthopedic Clinic of the University Heidelberg has been in existence since 2001. In the context of multimodal pain therapy patients with chronic and chronically recurring pain of the musculoskeletal system are treated. Methods: The present prospective long-term study investigated the effects of therapy using the following outcome parameters: pain intensity, disability, depression, functional capacity and vitality. For this purpose patients with low back pain (n = 59) were questioned in writing at four measurement times: start of therapy (t0), completion of therapy (t1), 6 months (t2) and 10 years (t3) following therapy. Of the examined patients 78% were in chronification stages I and II, according to the Mainz pain staging system (MPSS) of Gerbershagen. Aim: The main aim of the study was to examine the effects of multimodal pain therapy in the long term. Results: In the short, medium and long term significant differences were found in the outcome parameters with low to high effect sizes (d = 0.36-1.85). There was a continuous improvement of the pain intensity in the long term, and 10 years after pain therapy the effect size for the currently asked pain intensity was d = 1.28. Conclusion: Multimodal pain therapy is an effective method for the treatment of chronic back pain. It not only leads to short and medium-term improvements but also proves to be efficient in the long term. This form of pain therapy seems to lead to long-term success, particularly for patients with low-grade chronification. Copyright © 2017, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH.
